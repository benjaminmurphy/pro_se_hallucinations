*Plaintiff,*  

v.  

*Michael Williams,*  
*Defendant.*  

C.A. No. _________  

**COMPLAINT**  

**INTRODUCTION**  
1. This is a civil action brought by the Plaintiff, Jessica Turner, against her landlord, Michael Williams, seeking damages for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts General Laws, c. 186, § 14. The Plaintiff has been deprived of the full use and enjoyment of her rented apartment at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, MA, due to an ongoing mouse infestation that the Defendant has failed to remedy despite repeated notice.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
2. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, c. 218, § 19.  
3. Venue is proper in Worcester District Court under Massachusetts General Laws, c. 223, § 1, as the leased premises are located in Worcester, Massachusetts, and the alleged violations occurred in this jurisdiction.  

**PARTIES**  
4. Plaintiff Jessica Turner is an adult residing at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01604.  
5. Defendant Michael Williams is an adult landlord, residing in Massachusetts, who owns the property located at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01604.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
6. On or about May 1, 2022, Plaintiff Jessica Turner entered into a residential lease with Defendant Michael Williams for an apartment located at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01604. The monthly rent under the lease agreement is $1,200.  
7. Beginning approximately three months ago, in or around September 2025, Plaintiff began noticing evidence of a rodent infestation, including mouse droppings in her kitchen.  
8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the issue. Defendant responded by placing a small number of traps, which caught approximately two mice.  
9. Despite Defendant’s limited efforts, the infestation remains ongoing, with Plaintiff continuing to find droppings on a regular basis.  
10. The presence of mice and mouse droppings has rendered the kitchen unsafe for food storage and preparation. Plaintiff has discarded approximately $200 worth of infested or contaminated food and has spent $80 on plastic food storage containers in an effort to mitigate ongoing contamination.  
11. Plaintiff has communicated with the Defendant on several occasions, urging Defendant to take adequate steps to address the infestation.  
12. In response, Defendant hired an exterminator for a single visit, but has refused to undertake the comprehensive treatment recommended by the exterminator, citing concerns about costs.  
13. Defendant has attempted to minimize the problem, characterizing it as “normal for older buildings,” and has inappropriately suggested that Plaintiff keep her kitchen “cleaner.”  
14. The infestation has resulted in Plaintiff experiencing anxiety and distress, as she is unable to comfortably cook, eat, or store food in her kitchen.  
15. Defendant's failure to address the infestation constitutes a violation of Plaintiff’s statutory right to quiet enjoyment of her rental premises, as protected under Massachusetts General Laws, c. 186, § 14.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION – BREACH OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**  
16. Plaintiff incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 15 as if fully set forth herein.  
17. Massachusetts General Laws, c. 186, § 14 provides that a landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of a residential tenant may be held liable, and that such interference entitles the tenant to actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees.  
18. Defendant Michael Williams failed to take reasonable steps necessary to address an ongoing and significant rodent infestation affecting Plaintiff’s rental unit.  
19. Defendant’s failure to act has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy her apartment, including her ability to safely store and prepare food in her kitchen.  
20. Defendant’s conduct has been negligent and in violation of his duties as a landlord, as established under Massachusetts law.  
21. Defendant’s actions and inaction constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:  
1. Award Plaintiff $3,600 in damages pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, c. 186, § 14, representing three months’ rent for the substantial deprivation of her quiet enjoyment;  
2. Alternatively, award Plaintiff $280 in actual damages incurred for the cost of contaminated food and plastic food storage containers, and the value of the partial rent abatement Plaintiff is entitled to due to the interference;  
3. Award Plaintiff attorneys’ fees and the costs of this action pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, c. 186, § 14;  
4. Order Defendant to undertake a comprehensive extermination and remediation plan to address the mouse infestation; and  
5. Grant such further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

**JURY DEMAND**  
Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
