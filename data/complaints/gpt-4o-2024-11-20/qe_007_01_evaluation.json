However, in doing so the court squarely characterizes G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 14 as codifying the tenant\u2019s common-law covenant of quiet enjoyment and applies it in the context of damages for interference with use and occupancy. While this case focuses more on the liability standard than on the availability of damages, it does reaffirm that \u00a7 14 protects tenants\u2019 quiet enjoyment and is a vehicle for recovery when violated.",

St. 1927, c. 339, \u00a7 1. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 101-102 (1982). At common law, and as originally enacted by statute, the covenant of quiet enjoyment prohibited a landlord from wilful or intentional interference with a tenant\u2019s quiet enjoyment of the leased premises. In 1973, the statute was rewritten and the requirement of intentional conduct was eliminated; landlords could now be held liable for \u2018directly or indirectly\u2019 interfering with a tenant\u2019s quiet enjoyment of the premises.\u201d"

Accordingly, citing this case for the specific proposition that dust infiltration is a physical intrusion supporting breach of quiet enjoyment misstates its holding and reasoning.",
