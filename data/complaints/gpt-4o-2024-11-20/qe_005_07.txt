**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**
  
**SOMERVILLE DISTRICT COURT**  
**Civil Action No. _______**

**EMILY JOHNSON,**  
**Plaintiff,**  
  
**v.**  
  
**ROBERT SMITH,**  
**Defendant.**  

**COMPLAINT**  

**INTRODUCTION**  
1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson ("Plaintiff") brings this action against her landlord, Robert Smith ("Defendant"), asserting a claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law.  
2. This Complaint arises out of Defendant's failure to take appropriate measures to address ongoing and excessive noise disturbances caused by other tenants in the building, resulting in significant harm to Plaintiff's peace and well-being in her rented residential unit.  

**PARTIES**  
3. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Unit 2, Somerville, MA 02144.  
4. Defendant Robert Smith is an individual who owns and manages the property located at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, MA, and resides in Massachusetts. Defendant is Plaintiff's landlord.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
5. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in this Court because the rented property is located in Somerville, Massachusetts, and the events underlying this Complaint occurred in this jurisdiction.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
6. Plaintiff began her tenancy at 123 Elm Street, Unit 2, Somerville, MA 02144, on January 15, 2022, under a written lease agreement with Defendant.  
7. Under the terms of the lease agreement, Plaintiff agreed to and has paid $1,800 per month in rent, which is current as of the filing of this Complaint.  
8. The lease includes an express provision guaranteeing Plaintiff the covenant of quiet enjoyment as required by Massachusetts law. See Mass. Gen. Laws c. 186, § 14.  
9. Approximately six months ago, new tenants moved into the third-floor unit directly above Plaintiff’s apartment. Since then, these tenants have repeatedly caused excessive noise, including playing loud music, stomping at various hours of the day and night, and moving furniture late in the evening.  
10. Plaintiff has made reasonable efforts to address the issue directly with the upstairs tenants, and while they temporarily ceased the disruptive conduct, it resumed shortly thereafter.  
11. Plaintiff has notified Defendant on at least five separate occasions about the persistent noise disturbances, including verbal and written communications. Despite these notifications, Defendant told Plaintiff that he could not control how the upstairs tenants live and has taken no effective action to resolve the issue.  
12. The excessive and constant noise has deprived Plaintiff of her right to quiet enjoyment of her rental unit. Plaintiff averages four or five hours of sleep per night and has experienced significant adverse consequences as a result, including:  
   a. Receiving a written warning at work for falling asleep due to sleep deprivation, which jeopardizes Plaintiff’s job security.  
   b. Incurring monthly expenses of $40 for prescribed sleep medication to manage the ongoing sleep disturbances.  
   c. Purchasing additional items, such as a white noise machine and earplugs, to mitigate the noise, all to no avail.  
13. Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of her home continues to be unreasonably interfered with by the excessive noise and by Defendant’s failure to take effective action to abate the disturbances caused by his other tenants.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**COUNT I: Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (Mass. Gen. Laws c. 186, § 14)**  
14. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations in Paragraphs 1 through 13 as though fully set forth herein.  
15. Massachusetts law provides a statutory right to quiet enjoyment for residential tenants, which landlords are obligated to ensure under Mass. Gen. Laws c. 186, § 14. Any act or omission by a landlord that significantly interferes with this right constitutes a breach.  
16. Defendant’s failure to take adequate measures to address the ongoing excessive noise by the upstairs tenants, despite multiple complaints from Plaintiff, constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her rental property.  
17. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered damages, including emotional distress, loss of sleep, compromised health, and monetary losses totaling $1,200, representing the expenses incurred and the diminished value of her rental property due to the ongoing noise disturbances.  
18. Defendant’s actions and omissions also violate the protections afforded tenants under common law and Massachusetts jurisprudence, including cases such as **Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273 (1994)** (affirming tenants' entitlement to quiet enjoyment under Mass. Gen. Laws c. 186, § 14), and **Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977)** (establishing landlord liability for breaches of quiet enjoyment arising from third-party actions that the landlord could control).  
19. Additional legal authority further reinforces Plaintiff’s claim, including the following cases:  
   - **Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982)** (holding landlords accountable for ongoing tenant disturbances);  
   - **Bosse v. Litton Unit Construction Co., 288 Mass. 174 (1934)** (discussing tenant remedies for interference with quiet enjoyment);  
   - **Armstrong v. Rondoni, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 377 (2006)** (addressing consequences for violations of tenant rights to habitable living conditions);  
   - **Chiancola v. Bauman, 56 Mass. App. Ct. 397 (2002)** (examining damages recoverable for breaches of quiet enjoyment);  
   - **Rosenblatt v. Foley, 252 Mass. 188 (1925)** (highlighting a landlord's obligations regarding tenant disturbances).  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:  
A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and award damages in the amount of $1,200 or such other amount as this Court deems fair and just;  
B. Enjoin Defendant from further breaches of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and require him to take all necessary measures to abate the excessive noise disturbances;  
C. Award Plaintiff the costs of this action, including reasonable attorney’s fees as permitted under Mass. Gen. Laws c. 186, § 14;  
D. Grant any other relief this Court deems just and equitable.  

**DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL**  
Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,  
Dated: December 1, 2025
