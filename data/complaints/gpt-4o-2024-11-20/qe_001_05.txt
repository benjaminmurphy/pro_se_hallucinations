**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**BOSTON HOUSING COURT**

**Jessica Hartley,**  
Plaintiff,  
v.  
**Robert Thompson,**  
Defendant.  
__________________________________________  

**COMPLAINT**  

**INTRODUCTION**  
This is a civil action brought by the Plaintiff, Jessica Hartley, against her landlord, Defendant Robert Thompson, for breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment in violation of Massachusetts law. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant’s failure to provide adequate heat during the winter months rendered her apartment unfit and uninhabitable, forcing her to incur additional costs and experience serious personal hardship, including health issues. Plaintiff seeks damages pursuant to her rights under Massachusetts General Laws and common law principles.

**PARTIES**  
1. Plaintiff Jessica Hartley (“Plaintiff”) is an individual who resides at 27 Wilcock Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124. Plaintiff has resided in the rental unit since June 1, 2022, pursuant to a lease agreement with Defendant.  
2. Defendant Robert Thompson (“Defendant”) is, upon information and belief, the owner and landlord of the property located at 27 Wilcock Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124, which includes the unit rented by Plaintiff.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter under the provisions of G.L. c. 185C, § 3, as the claims involve violations of Massachusetts landlord-tenant law and arise out of the rental property located within Suffolk County.  
4. Venue is proper in Boston Housing Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1, as the events giving rise to this action occurred in Dorchester, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
5. On or about June 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant for the premises located at 27 Wilcock Street, Unit [specific unit, if any], Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124, for a monthly rental rate of $1,800.  
6. Under Massachusetts law, Defendant, as a residential landlord, has a duty to provide and maintain the premises in a habitable condition, including compliance with the state’s sanitary code at G.L. c. 111, § 127A and 105 CMR § 410.000.  
7. During the winter months of 2024–2025, the heating system in Plaintiff’s apartment failed to maintain adequate heat, causing the temperature in the unit to drop to approximately 60 degrees Fahrenheit for hours at a time, particularly in the evenings.  
8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant about the heating issue, and Defendant sent repair technicians on two occasions. Although minor repairs were performed, the heating system remained inadequate and continued to fail.  
9. One technician noted that the heating boiler was “old but functional” and concluded that there was “not much more to do,” despite the ongoing issue.  
10. The National Grid recommended temperature for heating an occupied home is approximately 68–72 degrees Fahrenheit. Massachusetts law requires that heat in a habitable dwelling must be maintained at no less than 68 degrees Fahrenheit from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m., under 105 CMR § 410.201.  
11. Due to Defendant’s failure to ensure working and adequate heat, Plaintiff was compelled to purchase two space heaters to keep her apartment habitable, incurring an additional $150 per month in electricity costs.  
12. Plaintiff contracted bronchitis in January 2025, which her physician stated was likely aggravated by the consistently low indoor temperatures, causing her to miss three days of work and incur $250 in medical expenses for antibiotics and related care.  
13. Plaintiff repeatedly informed Defendant of the inadequacy of the heating system by phone and email, but Defendant failed to adequately repair or replace the system or take other measures to resolve the problem. Instead, Defendant dismissively insisted that the heating system was “working.”  
14. As a result of Defendant’s actions, Plaintiff was deprived of the quiet enjoyment of her rental property, suffered emotional and physical hardship, and incurred significant out-of-pocket costs.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION: BREACH OF THE IMPLIED COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**  
15. Plaintiff restates and incorporates the allegations in Paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth herein.  
16. Under M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, every residential lease agreement in Massachusetts contains an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, which protects tenants from substantial interference with the use and enjoyment of their leased premises.  
17. Defendant breached the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment by failing to ensure that Plaintiff’s apartment maintained adequate heat during the winter months, as required under Massachusetts law.  
18. Defendant’s repeated failure to resolve the issued heating system constituted a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s lawful use and enjoyment of her rental premises.  
19. Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord is liable to a tenant when the landlord’s actions, or lack thereof, amount to a material interference with the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  
20. Defendant’s actions and inactions forced Plaintiff to endure persistent cold temperatures during the winter months, purchase space heaters at her own expense, and endure adverse health and financial consequences.  
21. Defendant’s conduct was intentional or, at a minimum, negligent in failing to repair the defective heating system and disregarding Plaintiff’s repeated complaints.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Hartley respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor as follows:  
1. For damages in the amount of $650 to compensate for the increased utility bills, medical expenses, and lost wages resulting from Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;  
2. For triple damages in accordance with M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, for Defendant’s material interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her rental premises;  
3. For Plaintiff’s costs and reasonable attorney’s fees pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186, § 14;  
4. For such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

Respectfully Submitted,
