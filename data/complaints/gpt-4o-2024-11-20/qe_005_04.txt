### COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
### SOMERVILLE DISTRICT COURT  

**Jessica Adams,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**Mark Thompson,**  
Defendant.  

Civil Action No. ___________  

**COMPLAINT**  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, **Jessica Adams**, by and through herself, and hereby brings this action against Defendant, **Mark Thompson**, for violations of Massachusetts landlord-tenant laws, specifically for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. The Plaintiff states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES

1. The Plaintiff, **Jessica Adams**, resides at 123 Maple Street, Unit 2, Somerville, MA 02143.  
2. The Defendant, **Mark Thompson**, is the landlord of the leased premises located at 123 Maple Street, Somerville, MA 02143. Upon information and belief, the Defendant’s principal residence and place of business is in Massachusetts.  

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE  

3. Jurisdiction is proper pursuant to M.G.L. c. 185C, § 20, which governs proceedings relating to landlord-tenant disputes in Massachusetts District Courts.   
4. Venue is proper in **Somerville District Court** pursuant to M.G.L. c. 223, § 1, as the events giving rise to this Complaint occurred in Somerville, Middlesex County.  

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

5. On or about **June 1, 2022**, Plaintiff entered into a written lease agreement with Defendant to rent the second floor of a triple-decker located at **123 Maple Street, Somerville, MA 02143**, for the monthly rent of **$1,800.00**.  
6. In the lease, Defendant covenanted to provide Plaintiff with "quiet enjoyment" of the rented premises, as required by Massachusetts law, including under **M.G.L. c. 186, § 14**.  
7. In or around **May 2025**, new tenants moved into the third-floor unit of the same building, also owned and managed by Defendant.  
8. Beginning immediately after their tenancy commenced, the upstairs neighbors engaged in **excessively loud and disruptive behavior, including stomping, playing music at all hours of the night, and moving furniture during the late hours**, substantially interfering with Plaintiff's ability to live peacefully in her unit.  
9. Plaintiff directly asked the upstairs neighbors to curb their noise on multiple occasions. Although this temporarily resolved the issue, the disturbances quickly resumed and have continued unabated since.  
10. Plaintiff has notified Defendant of these disturbances **at least five or six times**, but Defendant has made no reasonable effort to address the issue. Defendant acknowledged discussing the matter with the third-floor tenants once but stated that he "can't control how people live."  
11. Defendant’s failure to address ongoing noise violations has effectively deprived Plaintiff of the quiet enjoyment of her premises in violation of **M.G.L. c. 186, § 14**, which prohibits landlords from taking or failing to take actions that substantially interfere with a tenant's ability to use and enjoy their property.  
12. As a direct result of the persistent noise and disruptions, Plaintiff has suffered **chronic sleep deprivation**, leading to documented disciplinary action at work, significant personal inconvenience, and new medical expenses, including the cost of sleep medications at **approximately $40 per month** since **July 2025**.  
13. Plaintiff has mitigated damages by purchasing additional devices, including **earplugs** and a **white noise machine**, and by rearranging her bedroom, to no avail.

### IV. LEGAL BASIS AND CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – M.G.L. c. 186, § 14**  

14. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1-13 as if fully set forth herein.  
15. Massachusetts law imposes a statutory and common-law duty on landlords to ensure their tenants’ ability to use and enjoy their leased premises free from substantial interference. See **Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102 (1982)**; **Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 285 (1994)**.  
16. Under **M.G.L. c. 186, § 14**, a landlord breaches the covenant of quiet enjoyment when their actions or omissions “interfere substantially” with the tenant’s use of the premises. See also **Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184, 199 (1973)**.  
17. Defendant’s failure to adequately address the excessive noise caused by the upstairs tenants—despite Plaintiff’s repeated complaints—constitutes a deliberate or reckless disregard of Defendant’s statutory obligations under **M.G.L. c. 186, § 14**.  
18. The substantial interference suffered by Plaintiff has caused her **discomfort, loss of sleep, and financial injury**, all of which constitute compensable damages as established in **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850 (1997)** and **Roslindale Coop. Bank v. Greenwald, 638 N.E.2d 923 (Mass. App. Ct. 1994)**.  
19. Each instance in which Defendant failed to act constitutes a separate and distinct violation of **M.G.L. c. 186, § 14**, as held in **Dolben Co. v. Friedberg, 15 Mass. App. Ct. 924, 925 (1983)**.

### V. DAMAGES  

20. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered the following damages:  
   a. Emotional distress and discomfort resulting from chronic sleep deprivation;  
   b. Employment-related consequences from sleep deprivation, including a written warning at work;  
   c. Out-of-pocket expenses, including $40 per month for sleep medication;  
   d. Diminished value of the leased premises due to the Defendant’s failure to address the ongoing nuisance;  
   e. Other damages to be proven at trial.  
21. Pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 186, § 14**, Plaintiff is entitled to recover **actual damages** or **three times the monthly rent**, whichever is greater, in addition to attorneys’ fees and costs. See **Meikle v. Nurse, 474 Mass. 207, 215 (2016)**.

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Adams respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grant the following relief:

1. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of **$2,500.00**, or **three times the monthly rent ($5,400.00)**, pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 186, § 14**, whichever is greater;  
2. Award Plaintiff her costs and expenses incurred in bringing this action;  
3. Grant any further relief this Court deems just and proper.
