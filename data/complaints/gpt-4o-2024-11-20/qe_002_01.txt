This is an action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, as provided under Massachusetts law, arising from Defendant's failure to remedy serious water intrusion into Plaintiff's rental unit at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts, the resulting loss and damage to Plaintiff's property, and retaliatory threats of non-renewal of Plaintiff's lease.

2. Plaintiff seeks damages as a result of Defendant’s unlawful conduct, including statutory damages, compensation for property damage, and other relief this Court deems appropriate under Massachusetts law.

**FACTS**  
7. Plaintiff began renting the basement unit of 123 Maple Street on or around March 1, 2022, pursuant to a monthly rental agreement, and has paid $1,200 per month in rent.  

8. Beginning in November 2025, Plaintiff noticed water intrusion into the basement unit whenever it rained heavily. The water seeped through the wall, damaging the interior of the premises and Plaintiff’s personal property, including a rug and a bookshelf, for an estimated loss of $400.  

9. Plaintiff reported the water intrusion to Defendant via text message shortly after noticing the issue in November 2025. Defendant stated she would “look into it,” but no steps were taken to remediate the problem.  

10. Plaintiff subsequently contacted the City of Boston’s Inspectional Services Department, which inspected the property and documented areas of concern, including the water intrusion. The City issued notice to Defendant regarding these issues.  

11. The water intrusion has persisted, causing Plaintiff significant inconvenience and forcing Plaintiff to run a dehumidifier constantly to reduce the dampness, thereby increasing Plaintiff’s electric bills.  

12. On or about November 30, 2025, Defendant informed Plaintiff that she would not renew Plaintiff’s lease when it expires on March 1, 2026. Defendant attributed this decision to Plaintiff’s tardy rent payment in October 2025, even though Plaintiff has fully paid both rent and the applicable late fee.  

13. Plaintiff believes, and therefore avers, that Defendant’s decision not to renew the lease was motivated by retaliation for Plaintiff’s lawful decision to report serious code violations to the City of Boston, in violation of Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, § 18.

14. Defendant’s failure to promptly repair the water intrusion and the resulting damage amounts to a violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, § 14.

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (Mass. Gen. Laws c. 186, § 14)**  

15. Plaintiff incorporates the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1–14 as if fully set forth herein.  

16. Under Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to the quiet enjoyment of the premises free from interference by Defendant.  

17. Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment by failing to maintain the premises in a habitable condition. The persistent water intrusion constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff's use and enjoyment of the premises.  

18. Defendant’s failure to address the habitability issues despite repeated notice from Plaintiff and the City of Boston demonstrates deliberate disregard for Plaintiff's rights.  

19. As a result of Defendant’s actions, Plaintiff has suffered damages, including but not limited to: (a) property damage ($400); (b) increased electricity costs incurred by running a dehumidifier; (c) the diminished value of the rented premises; (d) emotional distress stemming from the uninhabitable condition of the premises; and (e) stress and hardship caused by Defendant's retaliatory conduct.  

20. Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to actual and statutory damages of up to three months’ rent, as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, if applicable.
