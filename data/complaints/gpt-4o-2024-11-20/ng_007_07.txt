James Thompson, individually and on behalf of  
his minor child, J.T.,  
Plaintiff,  
v.  
  
Brockton Community Center,  
Defendant.  

**Civil Action No. TBD**  

**COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND**  

**INTRODUCTION**  

1. This is a negligence action arising from injuries suffered by the minor child, J.T., at the defendant’s after-school program in Brockton, Massachusetts. Due to the defendant’s failure to adequately supervise participants and enforce the rules of safe play, J.T. sustained a concussion that caused significant physical injury, emotional distress, and financial hardship.  

**PARTIES**  

2. Plaintiff James Thompson is an individual residing at [Your Full Address], Massachusetts, and is the father and legal guardian of J.T., a minor child born on [Child’s Birth Date].  

3. Defendant Brockton Community Center is a community-based organization with its principal place of business at 75 Crescent Street, Brockton, Massachusetts, 02302.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 218, § 19, as this action seeks monetary damages that fall within the jurisdictional limit of this Court.  

5. Venue is proper in this Court because all of the events giving rise to this action occurred in Brockton, Massachusetts, and the defendant’s principal office is situated in this Court’s jurisdiction.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

6. The Brockton Community Center operates an after-school program at its facility located at 75 Crescent Street, Brockton, Massachusetts. The program is specifically advertised as one that provides adequate and consistent adult supervision to children during all activities, including playtime in the gymnasium.  

7. On or around September 15, 2023, at approximately 4:30 p.m., J.T., an eight-year-old child, attended the after-school program at the Brockton Community Center.  

8. At that time, J.T. was in the facility’s gymnasium with approximately 20 other children participating in free play activities.  

9. The Defendant’s policies require that at least two staff members supervise gymnasium activities to ensure children’s safety.  

10. However, at the time of the incident, only one staff member was present to supervise 20 children, as the other staff member left to attend to unrelated paperwork in the office.  

11. The supervising staff member who remained in the gym was inattentive, regularly looking down at her phone near the bleachers rather than actively supervising the children as required by the Defendant’s standards of care.  

12. During the gymnasium playtime, two older children, approximately 12 years of age, engaged in a physical and unsafe game of tackle football on the hardwood gymnasium floor.  

13. Multiple children alerted the supervising staff member to the unsafe activity. Despite this, the supervising staff member dismissed the children’s concerns, saying, “boys will be boys,” and took no steps to intervene or enforce appropriate behavior.  

14. Shortly thereafter, one of the older children violently tackled J.T., who was much smaller and younger, causing J.T. to fall backward and strike his head on the gym floor.  

15. J.T. lost consciousness for approximately 30 seconds as a result of the impact.  

16. J.T. was promptly transported to the emergency room, where he was diagnosed with a concussion. He was required to miss several days of school to recover and continues to experience symptoms associated with the concussion.  

17. As a result of the Defendant’s negligence, James Thompson has incurred medical expenses of approximately $5,000 and lost approximately $1,200 in wages due to missed work while caring for his son, J.T.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION: NEGLIGENCE**  

18. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 17 as though fully set forth herein.  

19. Under Massachusetts law, the Defendant owed J.T. a duty of care to provide proper supervision during activities at its after-school program, protect him from foreseeable harm, and enforce reasonable safety rules.  

20. The Defendant breached this duty of care by:  
   a. Failing to provide the required number of staff members for adequate supervision in the gym;  
   b. Allowing unsafe and aggressive play to occur without intervention;  
   c. Failing to enforce basic safety rules necessary for the protection of participants; and  
   d. Failing to ensure that the staff member present in the gym was adequately supervising the children.  

21. The Defendant’s breach of duty was the direct and proximate cause of J.T.’s injuries, including but not limited to his concussion.  

22. As a result of the Defendant’s negligence, the Plaintiff and his minor child have suffered and continue to suffer damages, including physical injury, emotional distress, medical expenses, and financial losses.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff James Thompson, on behalf of his minor child, J.T., demands judgment against the Defendant as follows:  

A. For compensatory damages in an amount sufficient to fully and fairly compensate the Plaintiff for the injuries and damages suffered, including medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering, in an amount to be determined at trial but not less than $6,200;  

B. For pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as permitted by law;  

C. For the costs of this action;  

D. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.  

**DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL**  

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

**Respectfully Submitted,**
