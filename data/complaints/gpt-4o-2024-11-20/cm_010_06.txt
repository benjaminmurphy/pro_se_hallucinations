_________________________________________

### **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**

**NOW COMES Jessica Turner, the Plaintiff in the above-captioned matter, and files this Complaint for Modification of the custody order entered by this Court on March 15, 2018, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28, 28A and applicable case law. In support of her Complaint, the Plaintiff states as follows:**

---

### **I. PARTIES**

1. Plaintiff Jessica Turner resides in Worcester County, Massachusetts, is employed full time, and is the biological mother of the minor child Emily Turner, age 10.  
2. Defendant Michael Turner resides in Worcester County, Massachusetts, and is the biological father of the minor child Emily Turner.  

---

### **II. JURISDICTION**  

3. This Court has proper jurisdiction over this matter because the last custody order involving the parties and the minor child, dated March 15, 2018, was entered by this Court, pursuant to G.L. c. 209B, § 2.  

4. The Plaintiff and Defendant, as well as the minor child, continue to reside in Massachusetts.  

5. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, this Court retains continuing jurisdiction to modify the prior custody order upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances that affects the best interests of the minor child.  

---

### **III. FACTS AND MATERIAL CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

6. The custody order issued on March 15, 2018, awarded primary physical custody of Emily Turner to Defendant Michael Turner and limited parental access for Plaintiff Jessica Turner to weekends and one weeknight dinner.  

7. At the time of the prior custody determination, Plaintiff was a graduate student, residing in a small studio apartment, and had a limited, inflexible schedule due to her academic commitments.  

8. Since the March 2018 order, Plaintiff’s material circumstances have improved substantially:  
   - (a) Plaintiff completed her graduate studies in [Field of Study] in 2020.  
   - (b) She has since secured stable, full-time employment and maintains regular working hours in an established position with benefits.  
   - (c) Plaintiff resides in a two-bedroom apartment located in a safe and child-friendly neighborhood, where Emily Turner has her own private bedroom.  

9. Emily Turner is now 10 years old and has expressed a strong desire to spend more time with Plaintiff. Plaintiff has a very close and supportive relationship with the child, and Emily has expressed feelings of guilt and distress due to the limited nature of her time with her mother.  

10. Emily Turner’s emotional struggles have been corroborated by her licensed therapist, who has advised that expanding Plaintiff's parenting time would be in the child’s best interests and contribute to her emotional stability.  

11. The minor child has also written a letter to the Court expressing her wishes for additional overnights with Plaintiff.  

12. Defendant Michael Turner has refused to engage in meaningful discussions on modifying the parenting schedule or to consider the minor child’s emotional needs and preferences.  

13. A modification of custody is warranted under G.L. c. 208, § 28, because there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances:  
   - (a) The Plaintiff’s financial stability, housing situation, and overall capacity to act as a custodial parent have improved significantly.  
   - (b) The emotional and psychological needs of the minor child have evolved, and her preference to spend increased time with Plaintiff is demonstrably in her best interest.

### **IV. REQUEST FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:  

1. Modify the existing custody order to establish a joint physical custody arrangement, and/or increase Plaintiff’s parenting time to include additional weeknight overnights, sharing holidays, and an equitable division of extended school vacations;  

2. Issue any other orders necessary to further the best interests of Emily Turner, in accordance with G.L. c. 208, § 28;  

3. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and appropriate.  

---

### **V. LEGAL ARGUMENT**

**14.** Massachusetts courts consistently hold that custody modifications require a showing of material and substantial changes that affect the best interests of the child. See *Schechter v. Schechter*, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015); *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012).  

**15.** A significant improvement in a non-custodial parent’s ability to provide a stable, nurturing environment constitutes a material change in circumstances under Massachusetts law. See *Dwyer v. Dwyer*, 71 Mass. App. Ct. 84 (2008).  

**16.** The child’s best interests, including emotional and psychological well-being, are paramount in custody determinations. See *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).  

**17.** Courts consider the preferences of older children in custody determinations, particularly where such preferences align with stability and emotional needs. See *Gilmore v. Gilmore*, 369 Mass. 598 (1976); *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219 (1998).  

**18.** Evidence of a child’s emotional distress and bonding with a parent supports modifications of custody. See *Fort v. Fort*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 411 (1981); *Loebel v. Loebel*, 77 Mass. App. Ct. 740 (2010).  

**19.** Defendant’s unwillingness to engage in cooperative parenting also warrants modification. See *Azia v. DiLasio*, 94 Mass. App. Ct. 596, 607 (2018).  

**20.** Good faith attempts to modify overly restrictive schedules are supported by Massachusetts public policy favoring the involvement of both parents in a child’s life. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; G.L. c. 209C, § 10.
