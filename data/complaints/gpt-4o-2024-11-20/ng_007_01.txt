**STATEMENT OF FACTS**  

6. On September 15, 2023, Plaintiff's minor son, J.C., was attending the after-school program operated by Defendant at its facility located at 123 Main Street, Brockton, Massachusetts.  

7. At all relevant times, Defendant owed a duty of reasonable care to ensure the safety and supervision of the children participating in its programs, including J.C.  

8. Defendant advertised and represented to parents that children in its programs would be supervised at all times, particularly in areas where physical activities take place, such as the gymnasium.  

9. On the date in question, approximately twenty children were in the gymnasium, but only one staff member remained present to supervise after a second staff member left to attend to paperwork.  

10. The sole supervising staff member spent a substantial period of time distracted by her phone and failed to monitor children in the gymnasium adequately.  

11. During this time, two older boys, approximately twelve years old, engaged in rough and dangerous play, tackling each other on the hardwood floor.  

12. Several children reported the behavior to the supervising staff member, who dismissively replied that "boys will be boys," and failed to intervene or take appropriate steps to stop the unsafe conduct.  

13. As a direct and foreseeable result of this lack of supervision, J.C., who is a smaller child, was tackled by one of the older boys during the rough play.  

14. J.C. hit his head violently on the hardwood floor, lost consciousness for a brief period, and required immediate emergency medical attention.  

15. J.C. was diagnosed with a concussion and has experienced symptoms consistent with traumatic brain injury, including headaches, dizziness, difficulty concentrating, and fatigue.  

16. J.C.’s injuries required emergency medical treatment at a cost of approximately $3,500.  

17. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, J.C. was deprived of several days of schooling and suffered substantial pain and emotional distress.

**CAUSE OF ACTION: NEGLIGENCE**  

18. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth in paragraphs 1 through 17 of this Complaint.  

19. Defendant owed a duty of care to J.C., a minor child enrolled in and participating in its after-school program, to provide adequate supervision and to protect him from unreasonable risks of harm.  

20. Defendant breached its duty of care to J.C. in the following ways:  
   a. By failing to provide adequate staff supervision in the gymnasium where children were engaged in physical activity;  
   b. By negligently allowing its staff to neglect their supervisory duties;  
   c. By failing to intervene and stop dangerous play after being notified of it; and  
   d. By violating its own advertised policies and standards regarding the supervision of children.  

21. Defendant's breaches of duty were the direct and proximate cause of J.C.'s injuries, pain, suffering, and associated damages.  

22. Under Massachusetts law, a childcare provider may be held liable when its negligent failure to supervise children foreseeably results in harm to those children. See, e.g., *Leibovich v. Antonellis*, 410 Mass. 568 (1991); *Irwin v. Town of Ware*, 392 Mass. 745 (1984).  

23. Through its negligent acts and omissions, Defendant created an unreasonable risk of harm, violating its duty to act with reasonable care under G.L. c. 231, § 85 and established principles of common law negligence.  

24. In allowing its staff to ignore reports of dangerous behavior and failing to prevent foreseeable harm, Defendant acted contrary to well-established standards of care as articulated in cases such as *O'Sullivan v. Shaw*, 431 Mass. 201 (2000), and *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973).  

25. Defendant’s conduct was not only a factual cause but also a foreseeable cause of J.C.’s injuries, consistent with principles established in *Poskus v. Lombardo's of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637 (1996), and *Carbonneau v. Trustees of Clark Univ.*, 353 Mass. 354 (1967).

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jason Callahan, individually and on behalf of his minor son, J.C., respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Enter judgment in favor of the Plaintiff and against the Defendant;  

2. Award the Plaintiff compensatory damages in an amount sufficient to compensate for:  
   a. J.C.'s past and future medical expenses;  
   b. Pain, suffering, and emotional distress experienced by J.C.; and  
   c. Any other damages deemed fair, just, and appropriate by the Court;  

3. Award costs, interest, and attorneys’ fees as permitted by law; and  

4. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
