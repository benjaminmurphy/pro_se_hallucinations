Plaintiff,  

v.  

**Mark Thompson**,  
Defendant.  

__________________________________________  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

**I. INTRODUCTION**  

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Sullivan, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody order dated September 15, 2021, concerning the minor child of the parties, Ethan Thompson, aged 8 years old. The Plaintiff seeks to modify the shared legal custody arrangement to ensure the health, safety, and well-being of Ethan, specifically by imposing restrictions on the Defendant’s custodial time and/or requiring supervised visitation.  

The Plaintiff avers that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the original custody order, rendering the current arrangement no longer in the child’s best interest.  

**II. PARTIES**  

1. The Plaintiff, *Jessica Sullivan*, resides at [Insert address here] in [City, State, ZIP]. She is the mother of the minor child, Ethan Thompson, born on [Insert date of birth here].  
2. The Defendant, *Mark Thompson*, resides at [Insert address here] in [City, State, ZIP]. He is the father of the minor child, Ethan Thompson.  

**III. JURISDICTION**  

3. This Honorable Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 209C, § 20 and G.L. c. 208, § 28A, as the parties are residents of Massachusetts and the original judgment was issued by the Bristol County Probate and Family Court.  

**IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**  

4. On or about September 15, 2021, this Court issued a Final Custody Order granting the parties shared legal custody of their minor child, Ethan Thompson. The Court found both parents to be stable and capable of co-parenting in the best interest of the minor child. Ethan was ordered to reside primarily with the Plaintiff, with scheduled weekend parenting time granted to the Defendant.  
   
5. Since the entry of the original order, a material change in circumstances has arisen such that the current custody arrangement is no longer in Ethan’s best interest as required under G.L. c. 208, § 31. Specifically:  

   a. The Plaintiff has become aware of troubling conduct by the Defendant during his parenting time. Ethan has reported that there are frequently "special drinks" at the Defendant's home and that, on occasion, the Defendant "can't walk straight." This language, while age-appropriate for an 8-year-old, suggests that the Defendant may be consuming alcohol or other intoxicating substances while caring for Ethan.  

   b. A neighbor recently sent the Plaintiff video evidence of the Defendant stumbling visibly while retrieving Ethan from his vehicle late at night, further corroborating the presence of alcohol or other intoxicants during the Defendant’s parenting time.  

   c. Ethan’s schoolteachers have informed the Plaintiff that Ethan consistently appears exhausted on Monday mornings following weekend visits with the Defendant, raising concerns about the stability and safety of Ethan’s home environment during the Defendant’s parenting time.  

6. It is in the best interest of the minor child that modifications be made to the existing custody arrangement to address these concerns and to ensure that Ethan is provided a safe and healthy environment consistent with G.L. c. 208, § 31 and the principles articulated in *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012).  

**V. REQUESTED RELIEF**  

7. The Plaintiff requests this Court order the following modifications:  

   a. That the Defendant’s weekend parenting time be supervised by a mutually agreed-upon third party or a professional visitation supervisor;  
   
   b. In the alternative, that the Defendant abstain from the use of alcohol and drugs during his parenting time and submit to regular testing to ensure compliance;  

   c. That, if necessary, the Defendant be ordered to participate in substance abuse counseling and/or parenting classes as a condition of unsupervised parenting time;  

   d. Such other relief as the Court deems necessary and appropriate under G.L. c. 208, § 31.  

**VI. LEGAL AUTHORITY**  

8. The Plaintiff’s request is supported by Massachusetts law recognizing that custody orders must be based on the best interest of the child, and where a material change in circumstances has occurred, modification is warranted to serve those interests. See:  

   - G.L. c. 208, § 28 (supporting jurisdiction for custody modifications).  
   - G.L. c. 208, § 31 (defining best interest of the child).  
   - G.L. c. 208, § 28A (providing grounds for supervised visitation upon evidence of a risk to the child).  
   - *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012) (affirming the best interest standard for custody determinations).  
   - *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006) (requiring consideration of material changes in circumstances for modification of custody orders).  
   - *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981) (noting that evidence of unstable parenting practices may justify modification).  
   - *Williams v. Massa*, 431 Mass. 619 (2000) (supporting imposition of conditions to protect a child’s well-being).  
   - *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981) (modifications may be ordered to address significant changes in circumstances affecting the child's well-being).  
   - *C.M. v. M.M.*, 72 Mass. App. Ct. 206 (2008) (noting that courts can order supervised visitation under certain conditions).  
   - *Sherman v. Sherman*, 480 Mass. 804 (2018) (holding that the court has broad discretion in custody matters to protect children).  

**VII. CONCLUSION**  

9. For the reasons stated above, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grant her Complaint for Modification, modify the existing custody order, and provide such relief as is necessary and just to safeguard the best interest of the minor child, Ethan Thompson.  

Respectfully submitted,
