v.  

**Lowell Home Goods, Inc.,**  
**Defendant.**  
**--------------------------------------**  
**COMPLAINT**  
**(Negligence)**  

**INTRODUCTION**  
1. This is a civil action brought by the Plaintiff, Jessica Mills, against the Defendant, Lowell Home Goods, Inc., seeking compensation for personal injuries sustained as a result of the Defendant’s negligent failure to maintain and manage its retail premises in a reasonably safe condition.  

**PARTIES**  
2. Plaintiff, Jessica Mills, is an individual residing in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  

3. Defendant, Lowell Home Goods, Inc., is a corporation organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, with a principal place of business located at 123 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts, 01852.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
4. This Court has jurisdiction under G.L. c. 212, § 4 because this matter involves a civil action where the damages exceed $25,000.  

5. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1, because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Lowell, Massachusetts, within Middlesex County.

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
6. On or about October 1, 2023, Plaintiff, Jessica Mills, was lawfully present as a business invitee at the Defendant’s store located at 123 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts, 01852.

7. While shopping in the kitchen appliance aisle of the store, Plaintiff sustained severe injuries when a large box fell from a high shelf and struck her on the shoulder and side of the head.

8. The box, identified as containing a heavy toaster oven, fell after another customer lightly bumped the lower shelf with a shopping cart.

9. Defendant had stacked multiple large and heavy boxes on upper shelves without using any safety devices, such as straps, barriers, or netting, to prevent the boxes from falling.

10. Defendant, through its employees, failed to take reasonable steps to ensure the safety of its customers by improperly stacking heavy merchandise in a manner that created a foreseeable risk of harm.

11. Immediately following the incident, the store manager created an incident report but took no further action to assist Plaintiff other than offering a store coupon.

12. Plaintiff sought medical treatment at an emergency room later that day, where she was diagnosed with a mild concussion and shoulder strain.

13. As a result of the Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff experienced dizziness, headaches, and pain in her shoulder, causing her to miss several days of work as a delivery driver and preventing her from participating in her regular recreational activities.

14. Plaintiff incurred medical expenses of approximately $1,200 and suffered lost wages of approximately $600 due to her inability to work while recovering from her injuries.

15. Plaintiff continues to experience discomfort in her shoulder and periodic headaches, further interfering with her daily activities.

**CAUSE OF ACTION – NEGLIGENCE**  
16. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations in Paragraphs 1 through 15 as though fully stated herein.  

17. Defendant owed a duty of care to invitees, including Plaintiff, to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition, to implement reasonable safety measures, and to protect customers from foreseeable risks of injury. See Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973) (establishing the duty of care owed to lawful visitors).  

18. Defendant breached its duty of care by:  
   a. Stacking heavy and dangerous merchandise on high shelves without securing straps, barriers, or other safety devices;  
   b. Failing to inspect and ensure that merchandise was safely displayed; and  
   c. Failing to implement policies or procedures to prevent falling merchandise hazards, despite the foreseeable risk of harm.  

19. Defendant’s breach of its duty of care directly and proximately caused Plaintiff’s injuries.  

20. Defendant had constructive, if not actual, knowledge of the hazardous stacking practices within its store and failed to take action to mitigate the risk, which constitutes negligence. See Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc., 448 Mass. 780, 785 (2007) (duty to remedy or warn of hazards that could foreseeably harm invitees).  

21. It was reasonably foreseeable that improperly stacked merchandise could fall and injure customers, such as the Plaintiff. See Papadopoulos v. Target Corp., 457 Mass. 368, 383 (2010) (foreseeability as a key element of determining duty).  

22. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained physical injuries, incurred medical expenses, suffered lost wages, endured pain and suffering, and experienced a diminished quality of life.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Jessica Mills, respectfully requests this Honorable Court grant the following relief:  

1. Enter judgment in favor of the Plaintiff and against the Defendant, finding the Defendant to have been negligent;  

2. Award the Plaintiff compensatory damages, including but not limited to, medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and loss of enjoyment of life, in an amount to be determined at trial;  

3. Award pre- and post-judgment interest, costs, and reasonable attorneys’ fees as allowed by law; and  

4. Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.  

Respectfully submitted,  

**Jessica Mills**
