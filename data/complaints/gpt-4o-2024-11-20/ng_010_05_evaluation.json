It does not address duties owed to persons using *adjacent public sidewalks* or speak to hazards emanating from the property onto public ways. The quoted concurring passage is about the treatment of trespassers and classification issues, not about sidewalk users or adjacent public ways, so the case does not support the specific proposition stated.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"The court holds that the measure of responsibility of an occupier should no longer depend on whether the injured person is characterized as a \u2018licensee\u2019 rather than an \u2018invitee,\u2019 or vice versa; the question is to turn on other, more vital factors. But footnote 7 seems to say that \u2018trespassers\u2019 stand apart, that that characterization is to remain decisive or highly influential.\""

The opinion focuses on whether the landowners owed and breached a duty to remedy the trampoline\u2011pool setup despite its obvious danger, not on a generalized knowledge/\u201cshould have known\u201d standard for all dangers.

It does not hold that Target\u2019s or Weiss\u2019s negligence was in fact the direct and proximate cause of Papadopoulos\u2019s injuries; causation and even breach remain unresolved fact issues.
