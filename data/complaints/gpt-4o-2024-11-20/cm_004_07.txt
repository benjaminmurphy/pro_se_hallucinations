**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**BRISTOL COUNTY PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT**  
**DOCKET NO. ___________**  

**SOPHIA REYNOLDS,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MICHAEL REYNOLDS,**  
Defendant.  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**  

TO THE HONORABLE JUDGES OF THE BRISTOL COUNTY PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT:  

**The Plaintiff, Sophia Reynolds, respectfully represents as follows:**  

### **I. INTRODUCTION AND NATURE OF PROCEEDING**  

1. The Plaintiff, Sophia Reynolds, brings this action to modify the custody order entered by this Honorable Court on May 15, 2018 (“the Original Order”).  
2. The Plaintiff seeks modification of the Original Order due to a material change in circumstances that warrants a revision of the existing custody arrangement.  

### **II. PARTIES**  

3. The Plaintiff, Sophia Reynolds, is an individual residing in Taunton, Massachusetts.  
4. The Defendant, Michael Reynolds, is an individual residing in Fall River, Massachusetts.  

### **III. JURISDICTION**  

5. This Honorable Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws c. 208, § 28, as well as c. 209C, § 20, as the Court previously issued the Original Order regarding custody of the parties’ minor child.  

### **IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**  

6. The parties are the parents of Ethan Reynolds (born February 15, 2017), age 8, who is at the center of this custody modification action.  
7. On May 15, 2018, this Court issued an order awarding primary physical custody of Ethan to the Plaintiff and parenting time to the Defendant, consisting of short weekday visits and Sunday afternoon visits, with no overnight parenting time due to the Defendant’s then-living arrangements.  
8. At the time of the Original Order, the Defendant was residing in a shared apartment with roommates and did not have appropriate accommodations for overnight parenting time.  

### **V. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**  

9. Since the entry of the Original Order, the Defendant’s living situation has substantially and materially changed, as he now resides in a private, safe, and stable two-bedroom apartment where Ethan has his own bedroom.  
10. The Plaintiff and Defendant’s minor child, Ethan, is no longer a toddler but is now eight years old, a full-time elementary school student whose academic and emotional needs have evolved since the Original Order.  
11. The short and frequent weekday visits provided under the Original Order have become disruptive to Ethan’s school-night routine, creating challenges with completing homework, adhering to bedtime, and maintaining overall stability during the school week.  
12. Ethan has expressed a desire to have more meaningful parenting time with his father, including overnights at the Defendant’s residence, which would allow for a less disrupted schedule and greater continuity of care.  
13. Both the Plaintiff and Defendant acknowledge that the current custody arrangement is not optimally serving the best interests of the child at this stage in his development.  

### **VI. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD**  

14. A modification of the Original Order is necessary to align with the best interests of the child, which is the paramount consideration in custody matters under Massachusetts law. *See Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 840 (2003); *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590, 598 (1996).  
15. The proposed modification would provide Ethan with a more age-appropriate parenting schedule that balances his need for quality parenting time with both parents and the stability required to thrive academically and emotionally.  
16. Massachusetts law recognizes that parenting plans should reflect the changing developmental needs of children. *See Ardizoni v. Raymond*, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734, 738 (1996).  

### **VII. REQUESTED RELIEF**  

17. In light of the material change in circumstances and the best interests of the minor child, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court modify the existing custody order as follows:  
   a. Award joint physical custody to both parents, or, in the alternative, provide the Defendant with one or two midweek overnight parenting times and alternating weekends, in addition to holiday and vacation schedules as the Court deems appropriate.  
   b. Implement a plan that prioritizes the child’s academic, emotional, and developmental stability while fostering healthy, supportive relationships with both parents.  

### **VIII. LEGAL BASIS FOR RELIEF**  

18. Massachusetts law allows for modification of custody orders when a material change in circumstances is demonstrated. *See G.L. c. 208, § 28*; *Schechter v. Schechter*, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239, 245 (2015).  
19. The Court may consider a child’s evolving developmental needs and quality of life when evaluating whether modification is in the child’s best interests. *See Pizzino v. Miller*, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865, 872 (2006).  
20. The stability, safety, and well-being of the child remain the controlling factors in custody modifications. *See Rosenberg v. Merida*, 428 Mass. 182, 191 (1998).  
21. The child’s express desire for meaningful contact with both parents is an important consideration under Massachusetts law. *See Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219, 231 (1998).  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Sophia Reynolds, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  
1. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the Original Order on May 15, 2018.  
2. Modify the Original Order to provide for a parenting schedule that includes overnight parenting time for the Defendant and reflects the child’s age, school schedule, and current needs.  
3. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.  

Respectfully submitted,
