**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
MIDDLESEX PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT  
WOBURN DIVISION  

**DOCKET NO.:** ___________  

**JESSICA THOMPSON,**  
Plaintiff  

v.  

**MICHAEL DAVIS,**  
Defendant  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and relevant Massachusetts family law, to modify the existing custody judgment entered on June 15, 2021. In support of this Complaint, the Plaintiff states as follows:

---

### **PARTIES**  
1. **Plaintiff:** Jessica Thompson, residing at [Plaintiff’s address], is the mother of Emily Davis (age 9). Since the custody judgment of June 15, 2021, Plaintiff has been the primary residential parent.  

2. **Defendant:** Michael Davis, residing at [Defendant’s address], is the father of Emily Davis.  

3. Both parties are subject to the jurisdiction of this Court.  

---

### **FACTUAL BACKGROUND**  
4. On June 15, 2021, this Court issued a custody judgment establishing joint legal custody of Emily Davis, granting Plaintiff primary physical custody, and awarding the Defendant substantial parenting time on weekends, including overnights from Friday through Sunday night.  

5. The parties were ordered at that time to “cooperate on matters affecting Emily’s education” and to “keep each other informed” with regard to Emily’s welfare.  

6. At the time this judgment was entered, Emily Davis was performing well academically, regularly attending school, and showing no behavioral or academic difficulties.  

7. Beginning in or around December 2024, Plaintiff became aware that the Defendant was failing to ensure that Emily attended school on Mondays following his parenting time. Defendant has asserted that Emily “needs a mental health day,” but no professional mental health provider has verified this claim.  

8. As a direct result of these absences, Emily has accumulated numerous unexcused absences, leading to truancy warnings from her school district.  

9. Emily’s academic performance has declined precipitously as a result, evidenced by poor grades and lower standardized test scores during the 2024–2025 school year.  

10. Defendant has also failed to facilitate Emily’s attendance at tutoring sessions scheduled during his weekends, despite their importance in addressing the academic challenges she now faces.  

11. The Defendant’s actions directly conflict with the best interests of Emily Davis and violate the spirit and requirements of the existing custody judgment that both parents cooperate regarding educational matters.  

12. These material changes in circumstances—namely, Emily’s increased absences, her academic decline, and Defendant’s failure to prioritize her education—warrant a modification of the current custody arrangement to better serve Emily’s needs.  

13. Plaintiff has made efforts to inform Defendant of these issues and to request his compliance with the current order, but these efforts have been unsuccessful.

### **RELIEF REQUESTED**  
WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  
1. Modify the existing judgment such that Plaintiff has sole legal decision-making authority regarding matters of Emily’s education pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28.  

2. Alternatively, modify the parenting schedule to eliminate Sunday night overnights and reduce the Defendant’s weekend parenting time to ensure that Emily consistently attends school on Monday mornings.  

3. Order any further or alternate relief that the Court deems necessary and just to serve the best interests of Emily Davis.

### **LEGAL BASIS AND ARGUMENT**  
14. Under **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, a custody order may be modified upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances, provided that the modification is in the child’s best interests.  

15. Massachusetts courts consistently emphasize that a child’s best interests are paramount in custody determinations, as established in cases such as **Care and Protection of Custody of Zita**, 455 Mass. 272 (2009), and **El Chaar v. Chehab**, 78 Mass. App. Ct. 501 (2010).  

16. Noncompliance with an existing custody order, particularly when it impacts a child’s education, constitutes grounds for modification. See **Smith v. McDonald**, 458 Mass. 540 (2010), where the court upheld a custody modification based on one parent’s failure to meet the child’s educational needs.  

17. A child's consistent school attendance is a critical factor in their well-being. In **Hunter v. Rose**, 463 Mass. 488 (2012), the Supreme Judicial Court affirmed a modification where one parent’s conduct adversely affected the child’s development.  

18. The Massachusetts Appeals Court in **R.D. v. A.H.**, 55 Mass. App. Ct. 394 (2002), ruled that a parent’s refusal to prioritize educational obligations can justify a modification in custody to serve the child’s interests.  

19. Similarly, the court in **Holloway v. Holloway**, 429 Mass. 707 (1999), clarified that when one parent demonstrates an inability or unwillingness to meet their parenting responsibilities, the other parent may be granted greater custodial rights.  

20. Defendant’s repeated failures to ensure Emily’s attendance and his refusal to cooperate with her tutoring sessions constitute a material change in circumstances materially impacting her well-being under **Judith B. v. Michael B.**, 410 Mass. 172 (1991).  

21. The modification sought here serves Emily’s best interests by ensuring that her academic, emotional, and developmental needs are protected, as required by **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704 (1985), and **Rolde v. Rolde**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).  

22. A reduction in Defendant’s parenting time or a restriction of his legal custodial authority is the least intrusive measure necessary to rectify the ongoing harm to Emily, consistent with **Rosenthal v. Maney**, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).
