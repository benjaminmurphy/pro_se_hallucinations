The court does not find that plaintiff\u2019s damages were solely and directly caused by defendant\u2019s negligence; instead, it concludes the defendant breached no duty and affirms judgment for the defendant. Thus, the case contradicts rather than supports the proposition of sole defendant negligence without plaintiff contributory negligence.",

The question to be decided, then, is whether the jury reasonably could have concluded that, in view of all the circumstances, an ordinarily prudent person in the defendant\u2019s position would have taken steps, not taken by the defendant, to prevent the accident that occurred. We are satisfied that, on the evidence, no such conclusion was warranted... It follows that the defendant\u2019s failure to adopt either of those measures did not constitute negligence.\""

Rodriguez analyzes when emotional distress damages are recoverable and how they must be corroborated, and then applies the statutory damages cap, but it does not stand for the broad proposition cited.

The holding is that a release does not bar claims for gross negligence and that the plaintiff\u2019s claim based on the flagman\u2019s gross negligence could go to a jury.
