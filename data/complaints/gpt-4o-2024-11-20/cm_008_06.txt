**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**BRISTOL COUNTY PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT**  

Docket No. ___________  

**JESSICA TAYLOR**, Plaintiff,  
v.  
**MARK JOHNSON**, Defendant.  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

**INTRODUCTION**  
The Plaintiff, Jessica Taylor, respectfully petitions this Honorable Court pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 209C, § 20 to modify the custody and parenting time order entered on June 15, 2020. The Plaintiff asserts that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred affecting the best interests of the parties' minor child, warranting a modification of the original judgment regarding legal custody and/or the Defendant’s overnight parenting time.

**PARTIES**  
1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Taylor, resides in Fall River, Massachusetts, and is the mother of Emily Johnson, age 10.  
2. The Defendant, Mark Johnson, resides in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and is the father of Emily Johnson, age 10.  

**JURISDICTION**  
3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 as the original custody order was issued by the Bristol County Probate and Family Court, and both parties remain residents of Massachusetts. Massachusetts is also the home state of the minor child pursuant to G.L. c. 209B, § 2.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
4. The parties share joint legal custody of their child, Emily Johnson, with the Plaintiff designated as the primary residential parent pursuant to the judgment entered June 15, 2020. Under the current order, the Defendant has parenting time on the weekends, including overnights on Sundays.  
5. The original order was based on circumstances in which both parents were expected to cooperate regarding school matters, and Emily was performing well academically.  
6. Since approximately January 2024, the Defendant has repeatedly kept Emily home from school on Mondays following his parenting weekends, claiming she "needs a mental health day." These absences are unexcused and lack any supporting documentation from a medical professional.  
7. Emily has missed at least 15 Mondays from school between January 2024 and November 2025 as a direct result of the Defendant’s actions, despite warnings from the school administration about the impact of excessive absences.  
8. Due to these absences, Emily’s grades have declined significantly, and her standardized test scores demonstrate a troubling drop in academic performance.  
9. Furthermore, the Defendant has refused to take Emily to tutoring sessions that occur on his weekends, despite being informed of the importance of this academic support.  
10. The Defendant’s conduct demonstrates an inability or unwillingness to prioritize Emily’s educational needs, which constitutes a material change in circumstances and adversely impacts Emily’s best interests.  

**LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION**  
11. A material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the judgment, specifically the Defendant’s repeated failure to ensure Emily’s school attendance and his refusal to support her academic needs.  
12. Massachusetts law authorizes the Probate and Family Court to modify custody and parenting time orders when a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred, and such modification is in the best interests of the child. G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20.  
13. A parent’s failure to support a child’s education or ensure attendance at school constitutes grounds for modification. See *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 263 (2001); *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 711 (1985).  
14. The best interests of the child are paramount in custody determinations. *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 183 (2006). Academic neglect, particularly in the face of documented harm to the child’s performance, merits judicial action.  
15. Massachusetts courts have consistently held that a parent’s inability to meet the child’s educational needs demonstrates a failure to act in the child’s best interest. See *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488, 494 (2012); *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590, 597 (1996).  

**REQUEST FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  
1. Modify the parties’ existing custody arrangement to grant the Plaintiff sole legal custody over educational decisions concerning Emily Johnson; and/or  
2. Modify the Defendant’s parenting time to eliminate his Sunday overnight visits, ensuring Emily’s ability to attend school on Mondays;  
3. Order the Defendant to comply with all school attendance requirements, including timely transportation to school during his parenting time;  
4. Award attorney’s fees and costs, if necessary; and  
5. Grant such other and further relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper.  

Respectfully submitted,  

**Jessica Taylor**
