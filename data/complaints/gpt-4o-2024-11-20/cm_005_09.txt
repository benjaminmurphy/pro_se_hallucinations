    Plaintiff,  
v.  
**David Robinson,**  
    Defendant.

### **Complaint for Modification of Custody**

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Emily Robinson, in the above-captioned matter, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody judgment issued on May 15, 2022. As grounds for her complaint, the Plaintiff states the following:

---

### **I. Factual Background**

1. The Plaintiff, Emily Robinson, resides in Norfolk County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor children, Liam Robinson (age 10) and Ava Robinson (age 8).

2. The Defendant, David Robinson, also resides in Norfolk County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor children.

3. On May 15, 2022, this Honorable Court issued a custody judgment granting shared legal custody to both parents, with primary physical custody awarded to the Plaintiff and a defined parenting time schedule for the Defendant, including every other weekend.

4. The custody judgment further directed both parents to (a) support the children’s relationship with the other parent, and (b) refrain from disparaging the other parent in the presence of the children.

5. Since the entry of the custody judgment, substantial material changes in circumstances have occurred, which have negatively affected the children's well-being, requiring this Court’s intervention to modify the existing arrangement.

---

### **II. Material Changes in Circumstances**

6. Over the past year, the Defendant, David Robinson, has routinely enrolled the minor children in extracurricular and community activities that occur during the Plaintiff’s court-ordered parenting time without first consulting or obtaining the Plaintiff’s consent.

7. The Defendant has repeatedly communicated to the children that it is the Plaintiff’s fault if they are unable to attend such activities during her parenting time, creating significant emotional pressure on the children.

8. The Plaintiff has learned through conversations with the children that the Defendant has made disparaging statements about the Plaintiff in their presence, including claims that she is “selfish” and “doesn’t really love them” when she requests temporary modifications to the visitation schedule.

9. As a result of these actions by the Defendant, the minor children, particularly Liam, have begun exhibiting signs of emotional stress and anxiety, including stomachaches on transition days between parents.

10. This change in circumstances has disrupted the co-parenting dynamic envisioned in the original custody judgment and, most importantly, is harming the physical and emotional well-being of the children.

---

### **III. Legal Standards and Relevant Authority**

11. Under Massachusetts law, this Court has the authority to modify a custody order when the moving party demonstrates a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the last custody judgment and that modification is in the best interests of the children. *See G.L. c. 208, § 28*; *Schechter v. Schechter*, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239, 245 (2015).

12. The best interests of the children remain the paramount consideration in all custody matters in Massachusetts. *See Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 710 (1985); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 840 (2003).

13. A custodial parent’s ability to foster a positive relationship between the children and the other parent is a critical factor in determining the best interests of the children. *See E.N.O. v. L.M.M.*, 429 Mass. 824, 828 (1999); *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 259–60 (2001).

14. Disparagement of one parent by the other has been held to undermine the children’s emotional stability and can warrant a custody modification. *See Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404 (1981).

15. Courts may also consider the emotional well-being of the children when evaluating a request for modification of custody. *See Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 185 (2006); *Bak v. Bak*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 608, 622 (1987).

16. Massachusetts courts seek to ensure that parenting schedules promote stability and minimize unnecessary conflicts between parents. *See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Custody of Zia*, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 237, 243 (2000); *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488, 495 (2012).

17. In the instant case, the Defendant’s consistent interference with the Plaintiff’s parenting time, disparagement of the Plaintiff, and the resulting emotional distress experienced by the children constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances, warranting a modification.

---

### **IV. Request for Relief**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Modify the custody order entered on May 15, 2022, to grant the Plaintiff sole legal custody of the minor children, Liam Robinson and Ava Robinson.

2. Modify the parenting schedule to provide the Defendant with reasonable parenting time at the discretion of the Plaintiff, ensuring it does not conflict with the children’s well-being or previously scheduled activities.

3. Order that the Defendant consult with and obtain the Plaintiff’s written agreement prior to enrolling the children in any extracurricular activities.

4. Order the Defendant to refrain from making disparaging statements about the Plaintiff in the presence of the children and to support the children’s relationship with the Plaintiff.

5. Grant such other and further relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper in the circumstances.
