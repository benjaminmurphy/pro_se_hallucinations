v.  

**Michael Davidson,**  
       **Defendant.**  
______________________________  

**CIVIL ACTION NO.: [To Be Assigned by the Court]**

**COMPLAINT**  

**PARTIES AND JURISDICTION**  

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Wang, is an individual residing at [insert residence address], in Newton, Massachusetts.

2. The Defendant, Michael Davidson, upon information and belief, resides at [insert residence address], also in Newton, Massachusetts.

3. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19, as the amount in controversy falls within the District Court’s monetary jurisdiction, and the events giving rise to this action occurred in Newton, Massachusetts.

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

4. On June 15, 2023, at approximately 4:00 PM, Plaintiff Jessica Wang was jogging on a public path at 30 Cole Ave, Newton, MA, a location commonly used for recreational activities such as jogging. 

5. The area where Plaintiff was jogging is part of a park governed by City of Newton regulations, which require all dogs to remain on leashes at all times, as prominently posted at various locations throughout the park. 

6. Defendant Michael Davidson was present in the park and had brought his large dog, which was not leashed at the time, in violation of these regulations. Although Defendant was in possession of a leash, he failed to ensure that the dog was secured by it.

7. While Plaintiff was jogging on the path in a reasonable and foreseeable manner, Defendant's unleashed dog suddenly charged toward Plaintiff while barking loudly and aggressively. 

8. The quick and alarming approach of the unleashed dog caused Plaintiff to fear for her safety and react instinctively by swerving off the jogger’s path to avoid the perceived risk of an attack.

9. As a direct result of swerving off the path, Plaintiff tripped over a tree root and fell down a small embankment, suffering a fractured wrist.

10. Defendant was standing approximately thirty feet away at the time of the incident, engaged in conversation with friends while his dog roamed freely and unleashed.

11. At no point did Defendant take reasonable steps to prevent his dog from approaching joggers or reduce the risk of harm caused by his failure to leash the dog.

12. Several witnesses who were also jogging or walking in the park observed the incident, including Defendant’s failure to secure his dog and Plaintiff’s subsequent injury.

13. Plaintiff sustained a painful wrist fracture requiring immediate medical attention, including an emergency room visit, imaging studies, and follow-up care. Plaintiff wore a wrist brace for several weeks and was unable to attend work or participate in scheduled activities, including a piano recital for which she had been practicing extensively.

14. Plaintiff incurred medical expenses of approximately $2,500 and lost income of approximately $1,200 due to her injuries, in addition to non-economic damages stemming from pain, suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life.

**CAUSE OF ACTION: NEGLIGENCE**  

15. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 14 of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein.

16. Under Massachusetts law, every person has a duty to act with reasonable care to avoid causing unnecessary harm to others (see *Glick v. Prince Italian Foods of Saugus, Inc.*, 25 Mass. App. Ct. 901 (1987)).

17. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of care to act in a manner that would prevent foreseeable harm to park users by maintaining control over his dog in compliance with the City of Newton leash regulations and exercising reasonable care in supervising the animal.

18. Defendant breached this duty by failing to leash his dog and allowing it to roam freely in a public space, creating a foreseeable and unreasonable risk of harm to pedestrians and joggers, including Plaintiff.

19. Defendant’s violation of Newton's leash law constitutes evidence of negligence under the principle of negligence per se (see *Adamian v. Three Sons, Inc.*, 353 Mass. 498 (1968)).

20. Defendant’s actions and omissions were the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries, as the sight and approach of his unleashed dog caused Plaintiff to take evasive action that resulted in her injury (see *Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637 (1996)).

21. It was reasonably foreseeable to Defendant that failing to leash a large dog in a public park might cause park-goers to react in self-protective ways and sustain injuries as a result.

22. Plaintiff’s damages were caused solely and directly by the negligence of Defendant, without any contributory negligence on the part of the Plaintiff (*Toubiana v. Priestly*, 402 Mass. 84 (1988)).

**DAMAGES**  

23. As a direct result of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff suffered:  
   a. Medical expenses in the amount of $2,500;  
   b. Lost wages in the amount of $1,200;  
   c. Non-economic damages including pain, suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life, in an amount to be determined by the Court (see *Rodriguez v. Cambridge Housing Authority*, 443 Mass. 697 (2005)).

24. Plaintiff is entitled to recover all damages resulting from Defendant’s reckless disregard of public safety and violation of Newton’s leash law, consistent with Massachusetts law (see *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973); *Zavras v. Capeway Rovers Motorcycle Club, Inc.*, 44 Mass. App. Ct. 17 (1997)).

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Wang respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment against Defendant Michael Davidson as follows:  

1. An award of damages in the amount of $3,700 for medical expenses and lost wages, plus additional non-economic damages for pain, suffering, and emotional distress, in an amount to be determined at trial;  

2. An award of costs, interest, and attorneys’ fees (if applicable);  

3. Such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.  

**JURY DEMAND**  

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,  

**Dated:** December 1, 2025
