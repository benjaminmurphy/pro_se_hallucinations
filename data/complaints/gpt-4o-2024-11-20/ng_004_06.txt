### FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  
6. Defendant Emily Johnson is the owner of a three-unit apartment building located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts.  

7. Under Massachusetts law, a property owner has a duty to maintain sidewalks abutting their property in a reasonably safe condition, including removing snow and ice in a timely and non-negligent manner when it accumulates so as to prevent hazardous conditions.  

8. On or about February 8, 2023, a significant snowstorm occurred, resulting in snow accumulation around the property located at 123 Maple Street.  

9. Following the snowstorm, Defendant cleared only a narrow path down the middle of the sidewalk but failed to take reasonable steps, such as salting, sanding, or otherwise treating the remaining ice and snow.  

10. Over the next several days, melting during the daytime and refreezing at night caused the shoveled narrow path to turn into a hazardous sheet of ice.  

11. Several tenants of the Defendant’s property observed the dangerous condition of the sidewalk and texted the Defendant, Emily Johnson, to report the issue.  

12. Despite receiving complaints and photographic evidence of the condition from her tenants, Defendant responded by stating that “the sun will take care of it” and failed to take further action to remedy the icy conditions.  

13. On February 10, 2023, Plaintiff Jacob Miller was delivering groceries to one of the Defendant’s tenants at 123 Maple Street.  

14. As Plaintiff traversed the sidewalk abutting Defendant’s property, his foot slipped on the icy path, causing him to fall backward and land forcefully on his lower back.  

15. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent maintenance of the sidewalk, Plaintiff sustained serious injuries to his lower back, incurring medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering.  

16. Plaintiff incurred approximately $2,500 in medical expenses for treatment for his back injuries.  

17. Plaintiff lost approximately $1,000 in wages due to being unable to work for one week following the incident.  

18. Defendant’s failure to adequately mitigate the hazardous ice condition on the sidewalk was unreasonable and negligent under the circumstances.

### CAUSE OF ACTION: NEGLIGENCE  

19. Plaintiff incorporates all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  

20. At all relevant times, Defendant owed a duty of care to members of the public, including Plaintiff, to maintain the sidewalk abutting her property at 123 Maple Street in a reasonably safe condition, including the removal or proper treatment of snow and ice after winter weather events.  

21. Pursuant to Massachusetts common law, including **Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693 (1973), property owners owe a duty of reasonable care to lawful visitors, including a duty to warn or remedy known hazardous conditions.  

22. Massachusetts law recognizes that property owners may be liable for injuries resulting from the negligent removal of snow under the "reasonable care" standard established in **Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.**, 457 Mass. 368 (2010).  

23. At all relevant times, Defendant knew or should have known about the hazardous ice condition created by her narrow, untreated shoveling of the sidewalk and her failure to salt or sand the area, especially after receiving complaints and photographs from her tenants.  

24. Defendant breached her duty of care to Plaintiff by failing to act reasonably under the circumstances to mitigate the hazards on the sidewalk.  

25. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff slipped and fell on the dangerously icy sidewalk, suffering injuries, incurring medical expenses, and losing wages.  

26. Defendant’s actions, or lack thereof, were in violation of Massachusetts law, including the principles elucidated in **Papadopoulos**, **Mounsey**, and **Barry v. Beverly Enterprises-Massachusetts, Inc.**, 418 Mass. 590 (1994).  

27. Defendant’s conduct also violated the duty of care outlined in Massachusetts case law regarding premises liability, including but not limited to:  
   - **Sweeney v. Ragged Mountain Ski Area**, 431 Mass. 437 (2000) (reasonable care extends to visibility of dangerous conditions);  
   - **Toubiana v. Priestly**, 402 Mass. 84 (1988) (snow removal must be conducted in a reasonable manner to prevent foreseeable harm);  
   - **Morash v. Wachusett Regional School District**, 410 Mass. 482 (1991) (proprietors have a duty to mitigate known hazards);  
   - And statutory duties codified under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 84, § 15 regarding liability for defects or hazards in public pathways adjacent to private property.
