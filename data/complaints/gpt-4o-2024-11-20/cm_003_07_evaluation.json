The burden of proof will lie with them to establish, by a preponderance of the credible evidence, that a decision by the judge to deny visitation is not in the best interests of the child. More specifically, to succeed, the grandparents must allege and prove that the failure to grant visitation will cause the child significant harm by adversely affecting the child\u2019s health, safety, or welfare.\u201d"

Its focus is on stability, safety, and permanency when a parent\u2019s conduct (here, chronic alcoholism and noncompliance) endangers the children.
