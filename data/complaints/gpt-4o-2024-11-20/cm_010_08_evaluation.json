The court does not emphasize or elevate the \"importance\" of older children\u2019s reasonable preferences; instead, it reaffirms that such preferences are one factor among many in a best\u2011interests analysis.

His father appears to have indoctrinated him with some dislike for his mother, and he has expressed a preference for Bielefeld. Furthermore, his familiarity with his father\u2019s life in Bielefeld, something Rosemary lacks, might possibly make sending him to his father less traumatic. On balance, however, the judge\u2019s decision, founded on a better knowledge of the parties than we can achieve from a cold record, is not plainly wrong.\n\nThe preference of someone Tony\u2019s age (ten at the time of the proceedings) is not given decisive weight, although it is a factor to be considered."
