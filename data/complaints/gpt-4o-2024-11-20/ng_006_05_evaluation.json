Thus, this case does not serve as authority for the broad, universal duty proposition cited.",

With respect to each such claim, the plaintiffs bear the burden of proving that the defendant committed a breach of the duty to use reasonable care, that the plaintiffs suffered actual loss, and that the defendant\u2019s negligence caused their loss.\n...\nBecause the plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden on the issue of causation, we need not decide whether they presented sufficient evidence to show that the defendant owed a duty of care to them sufficient to survive the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment."

The court vacates summary judgment precisely because there is a factual issue whether the physician\u2019s alleged negligence occurred while acting within the scope of his employment by BMA. This aligns with the proposition that a defendant is vicariously liable for a driver/agent\u2019s negligence if the conduct occurred within the scope of employment or engagement.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cTo prevail against BMA, the plaintiffs need only establish that (1) at the time of the alleged negligence Dr. Schlitzer was an employee of BMA, and (2) the alleged negligent treatment of the plaintiff occurred within the scope of Dr. Schlitzer\u2019s employment by BMA. Once employment is established, the only remaining issue is whether he was working for BMA at the time of the alleged negligent treatment, i.e., whether his treatment of the plaintiff was within the scope of his employment by BMA.\u2026 All that remains to be determined is whether the tort occurred within the scope of employment.\u201d"
