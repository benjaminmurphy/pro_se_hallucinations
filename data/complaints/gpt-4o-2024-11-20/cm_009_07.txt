**Case No. ___________**  

**Emily Johnson**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**Michael Johnson**  
Defendant.  

-----------------------------------  
**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  
-----------------------------------

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, and respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the custody and visitation provisions of the Judgment of the Barnstable Probate and Family Court entered on May 15, 2019. Plaintiff states that there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances that renders the existing parenting schedule no longer in the best interests of the minor child. Plaintiff makes the following allegations in support of this Complaint:

---

### **PARTIES**  

1. Plaintiff **Emily Johnson** resides at [insert address, if available], and is the mother of the minor child, **Sophie Johnson**.  
   
2. Defendant **Michael Johnson** resides at [insert address, if available], and is the father of the minor child, **Sophie Johnson**.  

---

### **JURISDICTION**  

3. This Complaint is brought pursuant to the Massachusetts General Laws, ch. 208, § 28, which grants the Probate and Family Court the authority to modify custody orders when there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare of a minor child.  

4. Venue lies in the **Barnstable Probate and Family Court** as this Court issued the original custody order and is the appropriate forum for the modification.  

5. A material change in circumstances affecting the minor child’s best interests has occurred, warranting the Court’s intervention and modification of the existing parenting schedule.

### **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

6. On May 15, 2019, the Court entered a Judgment granting primary custody of Sophie Johnson (date of birth: [insert DOB here]) to Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, with Defendant, Michael Johnson, having parenting time every other weekend and one midweek overnight on Wednesdays.  

7. Both parties resided in the same town at the time of the 2019 custody order, and the midweek overnight allowed for a reasonable five-minute commute to school on Thursday mornings.  

8. In or around [insert date if known, or "subsequent to the 2019 order"], Defendant moved approximately 90 miles away to Cape Cod, dramatically altering the feasibility of the Wednesday overnight visitation.  

9. Defendant continues to exercise the midweek overnight in accordance with the original schedule. He retrieves Sophie from school on Wednesdays, drives her 90 miles to his residence, and wakes her at approximately 4:30 AM on Thursday mornings to allow for the 90-mile return trip to her school.  

10. This schedule has caused significant fatigue and stress for Sophie, as evidenced by the following:  
   a. Sophie often complains of exhaustion;  
   b. Teachers have reported a noticeable decline in Sophie’s participation and focus on Thursdays; and  
   c. Plaintiff observes Sophie struggling to stay awake and concentrate after these disrupted school nights.  

11. Sophie's education and overall well-being are being adversely impacted by the continuation of this midweek overnight schedule.  

12. It is not in the best interests of Sophie to maintain the current Wednesday overnight visitation schedule under the significantly changed circumstances presented here.  

13. Plaintiff has proposed revisions to the parenting schedule to eliminate midweek overnights during the school year and to adjust weekend visits as needed, but Defendant has refused to compromise.  

14. The current visitation schedule is no longer sustainable or appropriate given Sophie’s needs and the Defendant’s relocation.

### **LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION**  

15. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, the Court may modify custody or visitation orders when a material and substantial change in circumstances affects the best interests of the child.  

16. A parent’s relocation, which significantly alters the feasibility of an existing parenting schedule, constitutes a material change in circumstances. See **D.C. v. J.S., 58 Mass. App. Ct. 1112 (2003)**.  

17. The physical and emotional well-being of the child is paramount in determining custody and parenting schedules. See **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704, 710 (1985)**; **Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177, 183 (2006)**.  

18. The best interests of the child standard includes considerations of the child’s routine, education, and overall stability. See **R.A. v. G.P., 89 Mass. App. Ct. 1135 (2016)**; **Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590, 600 (1996)**.  

19. Courts routinely recognize that excessively burdensome commutes and disrupted sleep schedules are not in the best interests of the child. See **Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 266 (2001)**.  

20. The child’s ability to maintain consistent and positive educational performance is a critical factor in determining best interests. See **Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 841 (2003)**.  

21. The circumstances of this case closely align with those in **Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540, 546 (2010)**, wherein the Court rejected visitation arrangements that imposed undue burdens on the child’s education and stability.  

22. Plaintiff has demonstrated good cause for eliminating midweek overnight visitation and modifying the parenting schedule to reflect Sophie’s current needs.

### **REQUESTED MODIFICATION**  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Issue an order eliminating the Wednesday midweek overnight visitation schedule;  

2. Adjust Defendant’s visitation schedule to reflect a weekend-only arrangement, or another arrangement that does not disrupt Sophie’s education or well-being;  

3. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and equitable.
