     v.  
**MICHAEL SMITH,**  
     Defendant.

**Docket No. _________________**  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

**NOW COMES THE PLAINTIFF, SARAH JOHNSON,** and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody order entered in this matter on October 15, 2021, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, G.L. c. 209, § 37, and the equitable authority of the Court. In support of this Complaint, the Plaintiff states as follows:

---

### **I. PARTIES**

1. Plaintiff, **SARAH JOHNSON**, resides at [Plaintiff's full address], within the jurisdiction of the Bristol County Probate and Family Court. Sarah Johnson is the mother of the minor child, Ethan Johnson.

2. Defendant, **MICHAEL SMITH**, resides at [Defendant's full address], also within the jurisdiction of this Court. Michael Smith is the father of the minor child, Ethan Johnson.

3. The parties are the biological parents of Ethan Johnson, a minor child born on **March 15, 2015**, who is currently ten years old.

---

### **II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**

4. On **October 15, 2021**, this Court entered a custody order granting the parties **shared legal custody** of Ethan Johnson. The order specified that Ethan would reside primarily with the Plaintiff, Sarah Johnson, while the Defendant, Michael Smith, would exercise parenting time during certain weekends.

5. At the time the original custody order was issued, the Court found that the parties were both stable and capable of co-parenting effectively in the best interest of Ethan.

6. Since that time, material circumstances have changed, creating concerns regarding Ethan’s safety and well-being during the times he is in Michael Smith's care.

7. Recently, Ethan has indicated to the Plaintiff that there are “special drinks” present at Michael Smith’s home and that alcohol consumption at the residence has impaired Michael Smith’s ability to care for Ethan.

8. Ethan also disclosed that Michael Smith is sometimes “unable to walk straight,” and exhibits behaviors consistent with intoxication or impaired judgment.

9. A neighbor of Michael Smith, who is aware of the circumstances of the custody arrangement, provided Sarah Johnson with video evidence showing Michael Smith stumbling and appearing disoriented while removing Ethan from a vehicle late at night.

10. Additionally, Ethan's schoolteachers have reported that Ethan frequently arrives at school on Monday mornings appearing overtired, lacking focus, and seeming unusually fatigued, a condition that seems to correlate with his weekends spent in Michael Smith’s care.

11. These circumstances indicate that Michael Smith's behavior and parenting environment may endanger the health, safety, and well-being of Ethan, contrary to the child’s best interest under G.L. c. 208, § 31 and related laws. 

---

### **III. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

12. The Plaintiff asserts that Michael Smith’s apparent alcohol abuse and its impact on his ability to parent Ethan represent a **material change in circumstances**, warranting a modification of the existing custody order.

13. Ethan’s safety and overall best interests are now at risk due to Michael Smith’s conduct, which constitutes a material change in circumstances under **G.L. c. 208, § 28** and accompanying Massachusetts caselaw.

---

### **IV. BASIS FOR MODIFICATION**

14. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, the Court has the authority to modify custody determinations where there has been a material change in circumstances and where the best interests of the child so require.

15. Massachusetts law recognizes that the paramount concern in child custody determinations is the **best interests of the child**. See **Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003)**; **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985)**.

16. Courts have consistently held that evidence of endangerment to a child’s physical or emotional well-being warrants modification of custody orders. See **Blixt v. Blixt, 437 Mass. 649 (2002)**; **Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006)**.

17. The burden of proof in demonstrating a material change in circumstances and the necessity of modification to protect the child’s best interests lies with the Plaintiff. See **Schechter v. Schechter, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015)**.

18. The Plaintiff asserts, based on the facts stated above, that Michael Smith’s behavior and its impact on Ethan have resulted in significant and ongoing safety concerns, constituting a material change.

19. Plaintiff further contends that the safety and well-being of Ethan require immediate action and appropriate conditions on Michael Smith’s parenting time.

---

### **V. REQUESTED RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Modify the existing custody order by imposing supervised visitation or other appropriate safeguards with respect to Defendant Michael Smith’s parenting time;  

2. Suspend unsupervised overnights with Michael Smith until such time as he has demonstrated to the Court that he can ensure a safe and stable environment for Ethan;  

3. Order Michael Smith to participate in alcohol or substance use evaluations, and to adhere to any treatment recommendations arising from such evaluations;  

4. Issue any further orders deemed necessary to protect the best interests of Ethan Johnson;  

5. Grant such other relief as the Court may determine is just and equitable.
