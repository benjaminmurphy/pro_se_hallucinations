The SJC reverses a restriction on visitation for lack of proof of harm and emphasizes the importance of frequent contact with both parents, and warns against limiting visitation based on speculative or inadequately supported claims of detriment. It does not endorse schedule modifications like the one described, nor does it frame such changes as presumptively reasonable to promote stability; it instead requires detailed proof of substantial injury to the child before materially limiting visitation.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cHowever, harm to the child from conflicting religious instructions or practices, which would justify such a limitation, should not be simply assumed or surmised; it must be demonstrated in detail\u2026 It is often said that if accommodation appears necessary, that form should be sought which intrudes least on the religious inclinations of either parent and is yet compatible with the health of the child\u2026 The decisions hold such an infirmity to be fatal to an action seeking to limit materially or to cancel visitation rights.\u201d"
