The opinion discusses at length the impact of distance, travel time, and the practical ability of each parent to exercise parenting time, which directly involves examining the practicality and feasibility of the parenting schedule.

      "support_reasoning": "The opinion applies the best-interests standard for an initial custody determination, not a petition to modify an existing custody or parenting order. While it recognizes that instability, wrongful removal, and alienating behavior that harm a child\u2019s well-being justify awarding primary physical custody to the other parent, it does not discuss or set the standard for modification of an existing parenting arrangement. Thus, it does not stand for the specific proposition that an arrangement adversely affecting a child\u2019s education and well-being constitutes sufficient grounds for modification.",

Factors a judge may weigh are whether one parent\u2019s home is more stable in terms of a parent\u2019s work schedule, whether siblings are being raised together, and whether one parent seeks to undermine the relationship a child has with the other parent.\u201d"

It does affirm broad discretion in custody-related decisions, but it does not involve modification of existing custody orders in response to a child\u2019s exhaustion or educational impact, nor does it focus on protecting children from such specific harms. Using Yannas as authority for modifying custody orders due to a child\u2019s exhaustion and educational difficulties overstates and mischaracterizes its holding.",

Unless one is to apply a fixed but arbitrary rule, the issue can be resolved only on a case by case basis. The effect on the child of any removal is most important. An evaluation of the best interests of the child requires attention to whether the quality of the child\u2019s life may be improved by the change \u2026 and the extent to which moving or not moving will affect the emotional, physical, or developmental needs of the child.\u201d"

The opinion focuses on relocation standards (Yannas vs. Mason), primary caretaker status, and general best-interests analysis, not on modifying custody orders due to a child\u2019s physical or educational strain. Thus, citing Murphy specifically for the proposition that it covers exhaustion and educational impact similar to the present child\u2019s circumstances overstates its holding and context.",
