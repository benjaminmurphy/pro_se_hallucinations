The court does not analyze or articulate the scope of any landowner\u2019s duty to persons on or near the property; it simply assumes some potential liability and holds that whether plaintiff was contributorily negligent or assumed the risk is for the jury. Thus, it does not serve as authority for the stated Massachusetts duty-of-care proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe issues argued by Hugh Nawn, Incorporated and New England Telephone and Telegraph Company are that the injured plaintiff assumed the risk and was contributorily negligent in that she left \u2018a place of safety\u2019 and \u2018voluntarily exposed herself to a danger which she . . . had to appreciate.\u2019\n\nUnder G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85, the defendants had the burden of proving contributory negligence. They also had the burden of proving that the plaintiff assumed the risk.\u2026 The questions of contributory negligence and assumption of the risk were for the jury to determine.\u201d"

Therefore it provides no support for the asserted proposition about what a reasonably prudent person would have done regarding a tree branch.",

Nowhere does the opinion discuss standards of reasonable care, premises liability, or failure to remedy or warn of a hazard. Accordingly, it does not establish or affirm the negligence principle described in the proposition.",

From the evidence introduced by the Commonwealth the jury could have found that the body found in the closet was that of Mrs. Burnett; that she had been murdered; and that the defendant had committed the murder on June 29. The jury could also have found that the defendant stole the radio from her by the use of force and was guilty of robbery."

The court emphasizes that the governor\u2019s condition and the loose/inoperative interlocks were either known or readily discoverable upon proper inspection, and that the elevator company had a contractual duty to maintain the elevator in a safe condition. This aligns with the proposition that failing to act when one knows or reasonably should know of a hazardous condition constitutes negligence.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "There was evidence from which the jury could infer that the elevator company had not cleaned the governor for more than ten years prior to the accident; that the congealed grease and accumulated dirt in the governor were readily observable upon inspection; that this condition had existed for at least six months prior to the accident; that Bay State was aware of the faulty condition of the interlocks; that the interlock which fell into the pit had been loose for some time prior to the accident; and that this defect too was discoverable upon proper inspection.\n...\nMost or all of the defects were either known to them or discoverable upon inquiry."

Although the opinion\u2019s main doctrinal focus is on duty to warn, the court expressly recognizes and leaves intact the jury\u2019s proximate cause finding as supported by the evidence. Thus, it is proper authority for the proposition that the defendant\u2019s negligence (failure to warn) was the proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries.",
