Ellard is a concurring opinion discussing the abandonment of the invitee/licensee distinction and the treatment of trespassers; it does not address duties regarding snow and ice removal or maintenance of sidewalks adjacent to property. While Mounsey is generally significant for expanding occupier liability under Massachusetts law, this excerpt does not establish a specific duty to remove or mitigate snow and ice hazards on abutting sidewalks. Therefore, this citation does not directly support the specific proposition about snow and ice duties.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "The court holds that the measure of responsibility of an occupier should no longer depend on whether the injured person is characterized as a \u201clicensee\u201d rather than an \u201cinvitee,\u201d or vice versa; the question is to turn on other, more vital factors. But footnote 7 seems to say that \u201ctrespassers\u201d stand apart, that that characterization is to remain decisive or highly influential."

It states that a property owner (or person responsible for maintaining the property) must act reasonably to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition, including with respect to snow and ice on areas such as walkways and parking lots, and applies this rule retroactively. That directly supports the proposition that a defendant owes a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain premises and adjacent walking areas in a reasonably safe condition by addressing snow and ice hazards.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cWe now will apply to hazards arising from snow and ice the same obligation that a property owner owes to lawful visitors as to all other hazards: a duty to \u2018act as a reasonable person under all of the circumstances including the likelihood of injury to others, the probable seriousness of such injuries, and the burden of reducing or avoiding the risk.\u2019\u2026 If a property owner knows or reasonably should know of a dangerous condition on its property, whether arising from an accumulation of snow or ice\u2026 the property owner owes a duty to lawful visitors to make reasonable efforts to protect lawful visitors against the danger.\u201d"

It does not discuss the reasonableness of the defendants\u2019 conduct in terms of taking simple remedial safety measures like applying salt or sand, nor does it analyze minimal steps to reduce a hazard. Therefore, it does not provide authority for the specific proposition about unreasonable conduct for failing to use simple measures such as salt or sand.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"At the time of the accident the trench was 'well lighted.' The weather 'was good and it was dry.' There were 'no horses, warning signals, barriers, or blinking lights in the area where she fell, or next to or around the trench or near the metal plate.' The placement of such barriers next to and around a trench was 'customary and usual.' ... The questions of contributory negligence and assumption of the risk were for the jury to determine.\""

It does not discuss premises liability, plaintiffs, sidewalks, icy conditions, business purposes, or notice of danger. Therefore it cannot be authority for the proposition about a plaintiff\u2019s lawful presence on a sidewalk and lack of notice of an icy pathway.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "These appeals arise from the sentencing of the defendant following his guilty plea to a charge of armed robbery in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 17 (1992 ed.), and to several other offenses.... The defendant was sentenced to from six to ten years at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Cedar Junction....

The court reiterates that liability traditionally attaches only when the owner has actual or constructive notice of a dangerous condition \"sufficient to allow time for the owner to remedy the condition,\" and then refines the notice element via the mode-of-operation doctrine, but still requires proof that the owner failed to take reasonable precautions. This squarely matches the proposition that knowledge plus failure to take reasonable remedial action constitutes actionable negligence.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 343 (1965), states: \u201cA possessor of land is subject to liability for physical harm caused to his invitees by a condition on the land if, but only if, he (a) knows or by the exercise of reasonable care would discover the condition, and should realize that it involves an unreasonable risk of harm to such invitees, \u2026 and (c) fails to exercise reasonable care to protect them against the danger.\u201d \u2026 This court has thus held that premises liability attaches only if a store owner has actual or constructive notice of the existence of the dangerous condition, sufficient to allow time for the owner to remedy the condition."

It does not address premises liability, hazardous property conditions, or standards for a property owner\u2019s negligence in failing to remedy known hazards. Accordingly, it provides no authority for the stated negligence proposition under Massachusetts law.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"The facts alleged would not be a defence to the action but would be ground, available by motion, for refusing to permit the employee to prosecute it... In this case, however, by the plaintiff\u2019s consent, the immaterial allegations in the amendment became a part of the answer and it was not thereafter open to him, as matter of right, to contend that they were not properly a part thereof... For this reason the denial of the motion was not reversible error.\""
