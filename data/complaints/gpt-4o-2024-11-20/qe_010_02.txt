**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
6. On or about May 1, 2022, Plaintiff began renting an apartment located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, MA 01851 (the “Apartment”) from Defendant for a monthly rent of $1,200.  

7. Plaintiff has consistently paid rent and fulfilled her obligations under the lease agreement.  

8. The bathroom in the Apartment is poorly ventilated, with no windows and only a single exhaust fan.  

9. Beginning in or around October 2025, Plaintiff discovered visible mold growth in the bathroom, which started in the corner of the shower and spread to the ceiling.  

10. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the mold on or about October 15, 2025.  

11. Defendant inspected the mold but denied responsibility, blaming Plaintiff for taking showers that were "too hot and too long" and for allegedly failing to run the exhaust fan consistently.  

12. Plaintiff has always taken reasonable steps to maintain the bathroom in a clean and habitable condition, including regularly running the exhaust fan.  

13. Since the mold appeared, Plaintiff has developed respiratory symptoms, including coughing, congestion, and wheezing, which her doctor has attributed to exposure to mold.  

14. Plaintiff was forced to discard personal property, including a shower curtain and towels damaged by the mold, incurring losses totaling approximately $60.  

15. Despite Plaintiff’s repeated requests, Defendant has failed to remediate the mold or improve the ventilation system to prevent recurrence, instead offering only to clean the visible mold.  

16. Defendant’s failure to adequately address the mold constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy her rental unit, in violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  

17. Plaintiff incorporates by reference paragraphs 1-16 as if fully set forth herein.   

18. Under Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, § 14, every residential lease includes a covenant of quiet enjoyment, which prohibits landlords from interfering substantially with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of their rental unit.  

19. Defendant’s failure to address the mold in the Apartment, despite Plaintiff’s repeated notifications, has interfered substantially with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her home.  

20. As a result of Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiff has suffered harm to her health and personal property, and the Apartment has been rendered partially uninhabitable.  

21. Defendant’s actions, and her refusal to remediate the mold and improve ventilation, violate the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and entitle Plaintiff to damages, including emotional distress damages.  

22. The mold conditions and Defendant’s responses are part of a pattern of negligence and willful disregard for the safe and habitable condition of the Apartment.  

23. Defendant’s conduct is further contrary to the protections set forth in the Massachusetts Sanitary Code, 105 CMR 410.000 et seq., which requires landlords to maintain rental units in a habitable condition and free from conditions that are harmful to occupants’ health.  

**Applicable Case Law and Authorities**  
24. In *Dartt v. Browning-Ferris Indus., Inc.*, 427 Mass. 1 (1998), the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court affirmed that a landlord’s failure to remedy harmful conditions may constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment if it substantially interferes with a tenant’s use of the premises.  

25. In similar mold-related cases, Massachusetts courts have recognized the duty of landlords to remediate hazardous conditions promptly. See *Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas*, 417 Mass. 782 (1994).  

26. The Massachusetts Sanitary Code expressly requires rental units to be free of conditions that endanger the health of occupants. See 105 CMR 410.602.  

27. The covenant of quiet enjoyment exists to protect tenants from unreasonable interferences, including conditions that impact health, safety, and the basic enjoyment of their homes. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).  

28. A landlord’s failure to act when notified of hazardous conditions may also result in liability for consequential damages, including health-related harms. See *Crowell v. McCaffrey*, 377 Mass. 443 (1979).  

29. Emotional distress damages are available in actions for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See *Manzaro v. McCann*, 401 Mass. 113 (1987).  

30. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a tenant may recover actual damages, punitive damages, and attorneys’ fees for violations of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See also *Doe v. New Bedford Housing Authority*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994).

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:

C. Punitive damages for Defendant’s willful disregard of her obligations under the covenant of quiet enjoyment;
