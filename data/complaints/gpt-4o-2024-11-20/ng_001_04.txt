### **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**
5. On September 30, 2023, at approximately 2:30 PM, Plaintiff was shopping at Greenway Grocery Store, located at 123 Main Street, Somerville, Massachusetts.  
6. While walking through the dairy aisle, Plaintiff stepped into a puddle of spilled milk on the floor and fell, landing on her hip.  
7. The puddle of milk was visibly large, with cart tracks running through it, indicating that the spill existed for a substantial period of time.  
8. No "wet floor" warning signs, cones, or other indicators of a dangerous condition were present in the area.  
9. At the time of the incident, a store employee was stocking shelves approximately fifteen feet from the site of the spill.  
10. After Plaintiff fell, the employee admitted that he had noticed the spill "a few minutes ago" but chose to continue stocking items rather than addressing the spill or warning customers.  
11. Plaintiff completed her shopping while in significant discomfort but sought medical attention at urgent care the following day.  
12. Plaintiff was diagnosed with a hip sprain and underwent physical therapy to treat her injury.  
13. As a result of this injury, Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,200 in medical expenses and lost approximately $800 in wages due to missed work.

### **CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**Negligence**
14. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through 13 as if fully stated herein.  
15. Under Massachusetts law, property owners and businesses owe a duty to maintain their premises in a reasonably safe condition for all lawful visitors. (See Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 708 (1973)).  
16. Defendant owed Plaintiff, a lawful visitor and business invitee, a duty of reasonable care to ensure the premises were free from dangerous conditions.   
17. Defendant breached this duty by allowing the spilled milk to remain on the floor for an unreasonable length of time without cleaning it or providing adequate warning to customers, such as warning signs or cones.  
18. Defendant further breached its duty when its employee knowingly ignored the spill, choosing not to prioritize the safety of customers. This failure to address and mitigate a known hazard constitutes a violation of the standard of care.  
19. Defendant either knew or should have known of the spilled milk, as the employee admitted to observing it prior to Plaintiff's fall.  
20. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff suffered injuries, including but not limited to a hip sprain, resulting in significant pain, medical expenses, lost wages, and other damages.  

**Applicable Authority**  
21. Massachusetts recognizes a property owner's duty to maintain their premises in a reasonably safe condition to prevent harm to invitees. (See Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693 (1973); Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., 363 Mass. 165 (1973)).  
22. The presence of a puddle on the floor in a grocery store constitutes a dangerous condition under Massachusetts premises liability law. (See Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc., 448 Mass. 780, 786 (2007)).  
23. A property owner or business is liable for injuries caused by a dangerous condition on its premises if the owner had actual or constructive notice of the condition and failed to take reasonable steps to address it. (See Sarkisian v. Concept Restaurants, Inc., 346 Mass. 31, 34 (1963)).  
24. In Massachusetts, an employee's actual knowledge of a dangerous condition is imputed to the employer, making the employer liable for failing to remedy the hazard. (See Restatement (Second) of Agency § 272 (1958); Giggey v. Century 21, Inc., 451 Mass. 1007 (2008)).  
25. Defendant's failure to act despite actual knowledge of the spill constitutes a breach of its duty to address known hazards in a timely manner. (See Thorson v. Mandell, 402 Mass. 744, 747 (1988)).  
26. Defendant's negligence caused foreseeable harm to Plaintiff, satisfying the required elements for a negligence claim under Massachusetts law. (See Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141, 147 (2006)).
