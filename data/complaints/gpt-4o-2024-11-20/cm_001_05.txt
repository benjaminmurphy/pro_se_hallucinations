      Plaintiff,  

v.  

**James Smith,**  
      Defendant.  
-----------------------------------------------------------  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**  

**NOW COMES** Rachel Smith, the Plaintiff in this matter, and respectfully moves this Honorable Court to modify the custody and parenting schedule previously established by the Probate and Family Court in the above-captioned matter. In support of this Complaint for Modification pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, G.L. c. 208, § 28A, and relevant Massachusetts caselaw, the Plaintiff states as follows:

---

**I. Overview**

1. The parties, Rachel Smith (Plaintiff) and James Smith (Defendant), are the parents of two minor children, Emily Smith (date of birth: [Insert DOB]) and Noah Smith (date of birth: [Insert DOB]).  
2. The current custody and parenting time order in this matter was entered on April 15, 2021, by the Middlesex County Probate and Family Court. Under the current order, Plaintiff has primary physical custody of the minor children, subject to Defendant’s parenting time every other weekend and one overnight per week.  
3. Material changes in circumstances since the entry of the prior order necessitate modifications to the custody and parenting time schedule to protect the best interests of the children.

---

**II. Jurisdiction and Venue**

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 209C, § 20, as both parties and the minor children reside in Massachusetts.  
5. Venue is proper in the Middlesex County Probate and Family Court under G.L. c. 208, § 28 because it is the court that issued the original custody order and because the parties and minor children continue to reside within Middlesex County.

---

**III. Factual Allegations**

6. At the time the original custody order was entered, both parties were employed in regular, daytime jobs that allowed Defendant to exercise consistent parenting time during the designated periods of overnights.  
7. In or around [Insert Date Defendant Began New Job], Defendant accepted a new position requiring him to work night shifts from 7:00 PM to 7:00 AM on multiple days each week, including many of the evenings he is scheduled to have parenting time and overnight custody of the minor children.  
8. Defendant’s night-shift schedule has severely impacted his ability to comply with the parenting time schedule as established by the April 15, 2021, order. Specifically:  
   a. Defendant frequently fails to provide adequate notice when he cannot exercise his parenting time, resulting in Plaintiff taking on full care of the children.  
   b. The children report being left with Defendant’s roommate during his parenting time, an individual whom Plaintiff does not know and who has not been screened or approved for caregiving responsibilities.  
   c. The children have also reported instances of Defendant falling asleep promptly after returning from his night shifts, leaving them unattended or sleeping on the couch in the morning hours.  
9. These circumstances place an undue burden on Plaintiff’s schedule, negatively impact the stability of the children’s living arrangements, and raise serious concerns regarding the safety and supervision of the children when in Defendant’s care.  
10. Plaintiff has made numerous informal efforts to address these issues directly with Defendant, but attempts to collaboratively revise the shared parenting schedule have been unsuccessful, necessitating judicial intervention.

---

**IV. Material Change in Circumstances**

11. Defendant’s acceptance of a night-shift job constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the 2021 custody order pursuant to the standard set forth in G.L. c. 208, § 28.  
12. The inability of Defendant to consistently exercise overnight custody, combined with the unsuitable caregiving arrangements during his parenting time, jeopardizes the children’s best interests as defined under Massachusetts law.  

---

**V. Request for Modification**

13. Plaintiff seeks an order modifying the current parenting time schedule to reflect the following changes:  
   a. Defendant’s overnight custody shall be limited to nights when he is not working and is able to provide direct caregiving and supervision for the minor children.  
   b. Plaintiff shall have the right of first refusal if Defendant is unable to exercise his scheduled parenting time due to work obligations or other circumstances.  
   c. An updated schedule for Defendant's midweek and weekend parenting time to account for his current work schedule and its impact on the children’s stability and well-being.

14. These modifications are necessary to promote the best interests of the minor children, protect their safety and well-being, and ensure consistency and stability in their living arrangements.

---

**VI. Relevant Authorities**

15. Plaintiff relies on the following statutes and case law in support of her request for modification:  
   a. G.L. c. 208, § 28 – Governing modifications of custody orders based on the best interests of the child and material changes in circumstances.

   g. Hunter v. Rose, 463 Mass. 488, 494 (2012) – Reiterating that the primary consideration in custody determinations is the child’s best interests.  
   h. G.L. c. 208, § 28A – Establishing mechanisms for modifying parenting schedules to protect children’s welfare.
