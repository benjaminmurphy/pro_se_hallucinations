v.  

**David Smith**  
Defendant  
___________________  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

**NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, and respectfully files this Complaint for Modification pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, and requests that this Honorable Court modify the custody and parenting time provisions of the Judgment entered on May 15, 2016. In support thereof, the Plaintiff states as follows:**  

---

### **1. Parties**  
1.1. The Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts. Her address and contact information will be provided separately via an Affidavit of Confidential Information, consistent with Probate and Family Court Standing Orders.  

1.2. The Defendant, David Smith, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and exercises primary physical custody of the parties' minor child under the current custody arrangement.  

1.3. The parties are the parents of Sophie Smith, born on June 15, 2015, who is now ten years old.  

---

### **2. Procedural History**  
2.1. On or about May 15, 2016, this Court entered a Judgment governing custody, parenting time, and related matters. The Judgment awarded primary physical custody of Sophie Smith to the Defendant, David Smith, with limited parenting time to the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, consisting of alternate weekends and one weeknight dinner.  

2.2. The custody and parenting time arrangement was appropriate at the time based on the Plaintiff’s circumstances, including her enrollment in graduate school, irregular schedule, and small housing arrangements.  

---

### **3. Material Change in Circumstances**  
3.1. Since the entry of the Judgment on May 15, 2016, there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances that warrants a modification of the existing custody and parenting time order in the best interests of Sophie Smith.  

3.2. The Plaintiff has made substantial improvements in her personal and professional stability, including but not limited to:  
   a. Completing her graduate education;  
   b. Obtaining stable and permanent full-time employment with regular business hours; and  
   c. Moving into a two-bedroom apartment in Bristol County, where Sophie has her own dedicated bedroom and living space.  

3.3. The Plaintiff’s relationship with Sophie has significantly deepened over the past several years. Sophie has expressed through her therapist and by letter to the Court a strong preference for increased overnight parenting time with the Plaintiff.  

3.4. The Plaintiff has evidence, including Sophie’s therapist’s professional opinion, that Sophie feels frustrated and emotionally conflicted due to the limited nature of her current parenting time with the Plaintiff.  

3.5. The Defendant, David Smith, has refused to engage in meaningful discussions concerning Sophie’s changing needs, effectively preventing the parties from informally modifying the schedule in Sophie’s best interests.

### **4. Best Interests of the Child**
4.1. Pursuant to Massachusetts law, including G.L. c. 208, § 31, modifications to custody and parenting time arrangements must be based on the best interests of the child. In determining same, courts consider factors such as the child’s evolving needs, parental fitness, and each parent’s ability to meet the child’s physical, emotional, and developmental well-being.  

4.2. The best interests of Sophie Smith require substantially increased time with the Plaintiff, consistent with Massachusetts appellate precedent affirming that strong and meaningful relationships with both parents best serve a child’s welfare. See McMahon v. McMahon, 31 Mass. App. Ct. 504 (1991); Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).  

4.3. The current Judgment is no longer consistent with Sophie’s best interests, particularly in light of the Plaintiff’s demonstrated stability and Sophie’s expressed needs and preferences. See Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219 (1998) (recognizing that a child’s expressed preferences and emotional well-being are critical factors).

---

### **5. Legal Authorities Supporting Modification**
5.1. A material and substantial change in circumstances justifies modification of existing custody or parenting orders under Massachusetts law. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; Schaffer v. Schaffer, 441 Mass. 1016 (2004).  

5.2. Massachusetts courts consistently emphasize the importance of fostering close and frequent contact between children and both parents when doing so aligns with their best interests. Hunter v. Rose, 463 Mass. 488 (2012).  

5.3. Sophie’s therapist’s opinions carry significant weight under Massachusetts law. The Court is authorized to consider expert testimony regarding a child’s emotional and psychological needs. See Adoption of Abby, 62 Mass. App. Ct. 816 (2005); Gilmore v. Gilmore, 369 Mass. 598 (1976).  

5.4. Where a child expresses a well-reasoned preference, Massachusetts courts consistently consider that preference in determining custody arrangements. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); Custody of Two Minors, 396 Mass. 610 (1986).  

5.5. The plain language of G.L. c. 208, § 28, authorizes the Court to modify custody where a parent’s circumstances have materially improved, warranting expanded contact.  

---

### **6. Relief Requested**  
WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  
1. Modify the Judgment of May 15, 2016, to award shared physical custody of Sophie Smith, or alternatively, to expand the Plaintiff’s parenting time to include additional overnights and holidays;  
2. Order the parties to work with a mediator to develop a specific parenting schedule consistent with Sophie’s best interests;  
3. Grant such further relief as the Court deems just and appropriate.  

Respectfully submitted,  
**Emily Johnson**  

Dated: December 1, 2025
