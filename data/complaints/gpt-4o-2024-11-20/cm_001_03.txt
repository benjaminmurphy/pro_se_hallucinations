v.  

**MARK DAVIS,**  
   Defendant.  
______________________________  

**Docket No. _______________________**  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**  

**INTRODUCTION**  

1. Now comes the Plaintiff, Lisa Montgomery, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court to modify its prior custody order entered on May 15, 2020. The Plaintiff contends that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred, and modification of the current parenting plan is required to serve the best interests of the minor children.  

**PARTIES**  

2. The Plaintiff, Lisa Montgomery, is the mother of the minor children, Emma Davis (born May 10, 2017) and Noah Davis (born February 12, 2019). The Plaintiff resides at [ADDRESS OMITTED].  

3. The Defendant, Mark Davis, is the father of the minor children and resides at [ADDRESS OMITTED].  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

4. The current custody arrangement, entered by this Honorable Court on May 15, 2020, grants the Plaintiff primary custody of the minor children, with the Defendant having parenting time every other weekend and one overnight during the week.  

5. At the time the original parenting plan was implemented, both parties worked regular daytime jobs, allowing the Defendant to exercise his overnight parenting time without significant disruption to the children’s stability and routine.  

6. On or about September 15, 2025, the Defendant began a new job where he works overnight shifts from 7 PM to 7 AM on several nights each week, including many of the nights coinciding with his scheduled overnights with the minor children.  

7. As a result of the Defendant’s work schedule, there have been repeated instances where:  

   a. The Defendant has failed to provide adequate care for the children during his scheduled overnight visits because he works late into the night or through the night;  
   b. The Defendant has dropped the children off at the Plaintiff’s residence at the last minute prior to or during his scheduled parenting time, citing exhaustion or scheduling conflicts caused by his employment; and  
   c. The Defendant has left the children in the care of his roommate, who is neither known to the Plaintiff nor authorized to care for the children.  

8. The Plaintiff has been informed by the minor children that during some of their time in the Defendant’s care, they were left to fall asleep on a couch while the Defendant slept off his overnight work shifts, further demonstrating disruptions in the children’s routine and stability.  

9. The Plaintiff has consistently accommodated the Defendant’s last-minute changes to visits, taking full responsibility for the children during times when the Defendant was unable to fulfill his obligations.  

10. The Defendant’s work schedule constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances that makes the existing parenting schedule impracticable, as the minor children’s best interests—including their safety, stability, and emotional well-being—are no longer served by the existing schedule.  

**LEGAL SUPPORT**  

11. Under G.L. c. 208, § 28, the Probate and Family Court may modify an existing custody or parenting time order upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and a determination that modification is in the best interests of the minor children.  

12. The Massachusetts Courts have consistently emphasized that the welfare and best interests of the children are the paramount consideration in custody and visitation determinations. See Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); Purdy v. Cole, 26 Mass. App. Ct. 517 (1988).  

13. Here, the Defendant’s new employment schedule directly affects his ability to provide consistent and appropriate care during his scheduled parenting time. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003) (courts consider safety, continuity, and stability of care as central to the children’s welfare).  

14. Massachusetts law also prioritizes the fitness of the custodial parent and the stability of the home environment when determining custody and parenting time. See Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); B.B. v. B.J., 73 Mass. App. Ct. 653 (2009).  

15. A material change in work hours or inability to adhere to a parenting schedule justifies modifying the custody order. See Schechter v. Schechter, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015) (court modified parenting plan due to changes in parent’s work schedule).  

16. The Defendant’s need to rely on a roommate for childcare further threatens the children’s best interests when such individuals have not been approved by this Court or adequately vetted. See Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996).  

17. Accordingly, the modification requested herein is appropriate to ensure the children’s best interests are met.  

**REQUESTED RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the original custody order entered on May 15, 2020.  

2. Modify the parenting schedule such that the Defendant is allowed parenting time with the minor children only on days when the Defendant is not required to work overnight shifts.  

3. Require the Defendant to provide at least 48 hours' notice to the Plaintiff if he is unable to exercise his parenting time due to work conflicts or other reasons.  

4. Issue such further orders as this Court deems just and proper to ensure the best interests of the minor children.  

Respectfully Submitted,  
**Lisa Montgomery**
