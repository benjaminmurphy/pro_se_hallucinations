v.  
**Michael Thompson,**  
*Defendant.*  

**Civil Action No. [To Be Assigned]**  

## COMPLAINT  

### INTRODUCTION

Plaintiff Emily Santos ("Plaintiff") brings this action against Defendant Michael Thompson ("Defendant") for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14 and related Massachusetts common law. Defendant's failure to repair the entry door to the building located at 45 Broadway St., Chelsea, Massachusetts, despite repeated complaints and the resulting interference with Plaintiff's peaceful enjoyment of her rented premises, violated her legal rights as a residential tenant.

### PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Santos is an individual residing in an apartment located at 45 Broadway St., Chelsea, Massachusetts, which she rents from Defendant. Plaintiff has resided at the premises since June 1, 2022.  
   
2. Defendant Michael Thompson is an individual and the landlord of the rental property located at 45 Broadway St., Chelsea, Massachusetts. Defendant rents apartments at said property to various tenants, including Plaintiff.  

### JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. Jurisdiction is proper pursuant to Massachusetts law, as this action involves a residential lease agreement executed in Massachusetts and a violation of Massachusetts statutory and common law.

4. Venue is proper in Chelsea District Court pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223, § 3, as the underlying events giving rise to this action occurred in Chelsea, Massachusetts.

### FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about June 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a rental agreement with Defendant, agreeing to pay $1,600 per month to rent an apartment located at 45 Broadway St., Chelsea, Massachusetts. Plaintiff has at all times complied with her obligations under the rental agreement, including paying rent in full and on time.  

6. The main entry door to the building at 45 Broadway St. has a broken lock that does not properly latch, allowing free and unrestricted access to any person without a key. This creates a significant security risk to the residents, including Plaintiff.  

7. On or about September 30, 2025, Plaintiff informed Defendant of the broken lock and requested that it be repaired. Defendant acknowledged the issue and stated he would address it.  

8. Defendant has failed to repair the broken lock despite Plaintiff’s initial notice and subsequent reminders on October 15, 2025, and November 1, 2025.  

9. As a result of Defendant’s failure to repair the broken lock, unauthorized individuals have entered the building. On or about November 10, 2025, Plaintiff’s package, valued at $120, was stolen from the common hallway.  

10. On several occasions thereafter, Plaintiff discovered signs that someone has been sleeping or loitering in the building’s basement, further contributing to her sense of insecurity and unease.  

11. In an effort to protect her tenancy and ensure her personal safety, Plaintiff incurred $200 in out-of-pocket expenses to purchase a deadbolt for her apartment door as well as a security camera.  

12. The Defendant’s statements dismissing Plaintiff’s concerns, including telling her she was "overreacting" and that the neighborhood was "safe," were unreasonable and ignored the factual reality of the security risks in the building.  

13. Plaintiff has experienced significant interference with her daily life and peace in her apartment due to the theft, the presence of unauthorized individuals, and the ongoing insecurity caused by the Defendant’s failure to repair the entry door.  

14. Defendant’s inaction and failure to address the issue has caused Plaintiff financial losses and emotional distress and constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law.  

### CAUSE OF ACTION  
#### Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14)

15. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  

16. Under Massachusetts law, all residential leases include an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, as codified at Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14, which requires landlords to ensure that tenants can use and enjoy rented premises free from substantial interference by the landlord or others acting under the landlord’s control.

17. Defendant's failure to maintain the entry door that secures the building constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment. Defendant knew of the defective condition and the resulting security risks and failed to act despite repeated notice from Plaintiff.  

18. Defendant’s breach directly resulted in unauthorized individuals entering the premises, including individuals who stole Plaintiff’s property and trespassed in common areas, significantly disrupting Plaintiff’s peace, security, and enjoyment of the premises.  

19. Defendant’s conduct constitutes a violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14 and breaches Massachusetts common law regarding the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  

20. Massachusetts courts have repeatedly held that landlords are liable for breaching the covenant of quiet enjoyment where they fail to remedy dangerous or disruptive conditions affecting the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises. See Warsowe v. Mosher, 20 Mass. App. Ct. 91 (1985); Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91 (1982); Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273 (1994); Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714 (1977); Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847 (1997).  

21. Defendant’s failure to repair the broken lock and address the resulting security issues in the building caused Plaintiff monetary losses, emotional distress, and a deprivation of her right to quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law.  

22. Pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to statutory damages of three months’ rent, or $4,800, as well as reimbursement of reasonable attorney's fees and costs of court.  

### PRAYER FOR RELIEF  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment against Defendant as follows:  

1. For an award of damages in the amount of $4,800 pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14 for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;  

2. For reimbursement of Plaintiff’s out-of-pocket expenses in the amount of $320 for her losses and mitigation costs;  

3. For pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;  

4. For Plaintiff’s reasonable attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14; and  

5. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and appropriate.  

Respectfully submitted,  
**Emily Santos**
