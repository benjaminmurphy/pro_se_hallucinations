The opinion focuses on when notice is inferred from the nature of self-service operations and on the plaintiff\u2019s burden of proof, rather than stating that such conditions must or could have been timely remedied in the ordinary-care sense asserted in the proposition.

Thus, because the determination of reasonableness is a question of fact, the trier of fact must determine whether the owner could reasonably foresee or anticipate that a foreseeable risk stemming from the owner\u2019s mode of operation could occur and whether the owner exercised reasonable care in maintaining the premise in a safe condition commensurate with these foreseeable risks.\u201d"
