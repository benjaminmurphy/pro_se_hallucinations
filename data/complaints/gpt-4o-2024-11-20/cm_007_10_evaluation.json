Instead, the case applies the general \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard and statutory factors under G.L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10(a) in an original custody determination between two fit parents. There is no holding or reasoning that a change in custody is warranted when a parent\u2019s physical impairment affects caregiving ability, so it does not support the specific proposition claimed.",
