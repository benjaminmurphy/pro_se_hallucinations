*Plaintiff,*  
v.  
**Thomas B. Mitchell,**  
*Defendant.*  

**Civil Action No. ________**  

**COMPLAINT**  

Plaintiff Jessica Harrington (“Plaintiff”), by way of this complaint against Defendant Thomas B. Mitchell (“Defendant”), states and alleges as follows:  

### PARTIES
1. Plaintiff, Jessica Harrington, is an individual residing at 123 Main Street, Apartment 2, Chelsea, Massachusetts, 02150.  
2. Defendant, Thomas B. Mitchell, is the owner and lessor of the residential property located at 123 Main Street, Chelsea, Massachusetts, 02150.  

### JURISDICTION AND VENUE  
3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19, as the undisputed amount in controversy is less than $25,000.  
4. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 2A, as the property at issue is located in Chelsea, Massachusetts.  

### FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  
5. On or about June 1, 2021, Plaintiff entered into a written lease agreement with Defendant for the rental of an apartment located at 123 Main Street, Apartment 2, Chelsea, Massachusetts. The monthly rent under the lease is $1,500.  
6. Defendant, as landlord, has a statutory and contractual duty to ensure that the leased premises, including the common areas, are safe and secure and to protect the tenant’s right to the quiet enjoyment of the property pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14.  
7. The main entry door to the building at 123 Main Street has a broken lock, which does not latch securely, allowing any person access to the building.  
8. Plaintiff first notified Defendant of the defective lock approximately two months ago. Defendant acknowledged the issue and stated he would repair it promptly.  
9. Defendant took no steps to repair the lock. Plaintiff reminded Defendant of the issue on at least two additional occasions; however, the lock remains unrepaired.  
10. Due to Defendant’s failure to repair the defective lock, unauthorized persons have entered the building. Plaintiff has experienced multiple incidents of theft and unauthorized activity, including:  
   a. The theft of a package shipped to Plaintiff, valued at $120, in or around October 2025; and  
   b. Evidence of trespassing, including apparent signs of someone sleeping in the basement.  
11. Plaintiff incurred expenses to improve her security due to Defendant’s inaction, including purchasing a security camera and a new deadbolt for her apartment door at a cost of approximately $200.  
12. Defendant has trivialized Plaintiff’s concerns, stating that she is “overreacting” and “the neighborhood is safe,” despite significant evidence to the contrary.  
13. Defendant’s actions and inaction have substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s right to use and enjoy her leased premises in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14, which prohibits interference with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of their rental property.  
14. Plaintiff has suffered emotional distress, anxiety about her safety and security, and financial harm due to Defendant’s failure to address the defective lock and subsequent security issues.  

### CAUSE OF ACTION  
**(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  
15. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations in paragraphs 1–14 as if fully set forth herein.  
16. Under Massachusetts law, Defendant had a duty to ensure that Plaintiff could peacefully enjoy her tenancy without interference. G.L. c. 186, § 14.  
17. Defendant violated Plaintiff’s covenant of quiet enjoyment by:  
   a. Failing to address known security concerns, including the defective lock, which permitted unauthorized persons to access the building;  
   b. Failing to repair common areas of the property to prevent trespassers and theft; and  
   c. Failing to take reasonable steps to ensure that Plaintiff’s tenancy was safe and secure.  
18. Defendant’s failure to act despite Plaintiff’s repeated complaints amounts to willful and knowing violations of the covenant of quiet enjoyment as recognized by Massachusetts law.  
19. Plaintiff has suffered monetary damages, emotional distress, and a diminished quality of life as a direct result of Defendant’s conduct.  

**Caselaw Support:**  
20. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in every residential lease in Massachusetts. *Boston Housing Authority v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184, 199 (1973).  
21. A breach occurs when a landlord substantially interferes with the tenant’s lawful use and enjoyment of the premises. *Doe v. New Bedford Housing Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273, 285 (1994).  
22. Massachusetts courts have held that security deficiencies resulting in tenant harm breach the covenant of quiet enjoyment. *Dorgan v. Loukas*, 19 Mass. App. Ct. 959, 960 (1985).  
23. The obligation to address known property defects is a fundamental landlord duty. *Lyon v. Broomfield Gardens Apartments, Inc.*, 1994 Mass. App. Div. 49, 50.  
24. Massachusetts General Laws protect against intentional or negligent acts by landlords that cause tenant harm. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 102 (1982).  
25. Failure to repair critical security measures constitutes a “willful or negligent” interference under G.L. c. 186, § 14. *Brown v. Laconia Dev. Co.*, 1984 Mass. App. Div. 133, 134.  
26. Willful misconduct can result where the landlord trivializes the tenant’s legitimate concerns. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. at 102.  
27. The statute provides treble damages and attorneys’ fees for violations. G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

### PRAYER FOR RELIEF  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Harrington respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:  
1. An award of actual damages, including but not limited to $320 for monetary losses caused by Defendant’s conduct;  
2. Treble damages for Defendant’s willful and knowing interference with Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14;  
3. An order compelling Defendant to repair the defective lock and take appropriate measures to secure the building;  
4. Costs of suit; and  
5. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

### JURY DEMAND  
Plaintiff demands a jury trial on all issues so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,
