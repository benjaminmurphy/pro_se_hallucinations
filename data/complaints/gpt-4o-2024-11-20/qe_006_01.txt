**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**BROCKTON DISTRICT COURT**  

**Emily Johnson,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**Mark Thompson,**  
Defendant.  

CIVIL ACTION NO.: ___________  

**COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**  

**INTRODUCTION**  
1. This is an action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts General Laws, chapter 186, section 14, based on the Defendant’s failure to provide hot water to the Plaintiff's rental unit for an extended period of time.  

**PARTIES**  
2. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing at 25 Cedar Street, Brockton, Massachusetts, 02302.  
3. Defendant Mark Thompson is the landlord and owner of the property located at 25 Cedar Street, Brockton, Massachusetts, 02302.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 1.  
5. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 8, as the events giving rise to this claim occurred in Brockton, Massachusetts.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
6. Plaintiff began leasing the premises located at 25 Cedar Street, Brockton, Massachusetts, from Defendant on or about January 15, 2022, under the terms of a tenancy-at-will agreement.  
7. Plaintiff pays monthly rent of $1,500.  
8. On or about November 8, 2025, the hot water in Plaintiff’s rental unit ceased functioning.  
9. Plaintiff immediately reported the lack of hot water to Defendant on the same day.  
10. Defendant informed Plaintiff that the water heater required a replacement part and claimed he had ordered it.  
11. More than three weeks have passed since Plaintiff initially reported the lack of hot water, but Defendant has failed to restore hot water to the premises.  
12. During this time, Plaintiff has had no choice but to endure cold showers and boil water for essential household needs.  
13. Plaintiff incurred additional expenses to travel to a gym and pay for a membership to have access to hot showers at the gym. Plaintiff estimates these additional expenses to be approximately $30 per month, plus the cost of gas for travel.  
14. Furthermore, Plaintiff was forced to transport her infant child to her mother’s home in order to provide her child with warm baths, causing further inconvenience and disruption.  
15. Despite repeated communications from Plaintiff, Defendant has failed to remedy the issue in a timely manner and has left Plaintiff and her family in an untenable living situation.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**Count I** – Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment  
16. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 15 as if fully set forth herein.  
17. Under Massachusetts law, tenants are entitled to the covenant of quiet enjoyment pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14.  
18. The covenant of quiet enjoyment requires landlords to maintain leased premises in a condition fit for human habitation, including providing essential services such as hot water. See *Dartmouth Harness v. Borkowski*, 452 Mass. 105, 111 (2008).  
19. The failure to provide hot water for an extended period of time constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See *Jablonski v. Casey*, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744, 749-750 (2005).  
20. Defendant’s failure to restore hot water to the premises materially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her rental unit. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 102-03 (1982).  
21. Defendant’s breaches were not occasioned by conditions beyond his control but instead reflect an unreasonable delay in repairing the property. See *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, 410 Mass. 855, 866 (1991).  
22. Defendant’s failure to comply with G.L. c. 186, § 14 entitles Plaintiff to actual damages, emotional distress damages, attorney’s fees, and potentially punitive damages for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273, 283 (1994).  
23. Defendant’s ongoing failures to repair the water heater constitute a "substantial interference with quiet enjoyment," as recognized by G.L. c. 186, § 14 and cases such as *Bosse v. O'Connor*, 30 Mass. App. Ct. 602, 604 (1991).  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Johnson respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment against Defendant Mark Thompson and grant the following relief:  
1. Actual damages in the amount of $450 or an amount to be determined at trial to compensate Plaintiff for increased expenses and inconvenience.  
2. Emotional distress damages for Plaintiff’s suffering and disruption to her life caused by Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  
3. Attorney’s fees and costs pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14.  
4. Punitive damages as authorized by G.L. c. 186, § 14 and applicable case law.  
5. Such other relief as this Court deems just and equitable.  

**DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL**  
Pursuant to Massachusetts Rule of Civil Procedure 38, Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,
