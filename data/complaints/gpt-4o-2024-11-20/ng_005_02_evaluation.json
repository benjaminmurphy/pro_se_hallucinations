      "support_reasoning": "Mounsey abolishes the common\u2011law distinction between invitees and licensees and replaces it with a general duty of reasonable care owed by landowners/occupiers to all lawful visitors. That principle is broad enough to encompass a duty to exercise reasonable care regarding dangerous conditions or objects on the property, such as a tall aluminum ladder that could foreseeably harm a lawful visitor or her property. The quoted concurrence critiques treatment of trespassers but is consistent with the majority\u2019s move to a general reasonable\u2011care standard for lawful entrants.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "[T]he court holds that the measure of responsibility of an occupier should no longer depend on whether the injured person is characterized as a \u201clicensee\u201d rather than an \u201cinvitee,\u201d or vice versa; the question is to turn on other, more vital factors. \u2026 Thus it is awkward to leave the suggestion that the basic reasoning of the court\u2019s opinion may stop short of so called trespassers."

Justice Lynch agrees only that the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were not within the reasonably foreseeable risk of harm created by Lombardo\u2019s negligence; he does not articulate or endorse the broader duty proposition about securing a ladder in windy conditions.

Instead, the court affirms summary judgment because plaintiffs failed to prove causation\u2014i.e., any link between defendant\u2019s conduct and their injuries. The proposition about foreseeability-based recoverability of damages is therefore not supported by this case and the pinpoint page (696) concerns elements of negligence and lack of causation, not types of damages.",

The proposition\u2014that failing to take minimal precautions to correct a known instability constitutes negligent conduct\u2014is a specific application of Papadopoulos\u2019s broader rule that failure to address known hazards (of whatever type) may amount to negligence.
