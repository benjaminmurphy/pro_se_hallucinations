It does not involve a negligence or premises-liability context, a \u201cshared driveway,\u201d or a general duty of reasonable care to prevent foreseeable physical harm.

The opinion addresses foreseeability, duty, and proximate cause in the context of personal injury from criminal assault, not property damage causation or the specific types of damages described in the proposition. Therefore, it does not provide authority for the claimed proposition about vehicle property damage resulting from negligence.",

The opinion clarifies that violations of those alcohol-related statutes do not constitute negligence per se and that any liability must be grounded in common-law negligence, which is found lacking here. Thus, the decision undermines, rather than supports, the proposition that the defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes negligence under Massachusetts common law or statutory law.",

It has long been the rule in this Commonwealth that violation of a statute does not by itself establish a breach of duty, for it does not constitute negligence per se... Since no common law duty exists here, it follows that the statutes relied on by the plaintiff do not of themselves create a cause of action in tort.\""
