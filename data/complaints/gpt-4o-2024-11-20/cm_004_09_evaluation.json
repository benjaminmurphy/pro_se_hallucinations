The court emphasizes that the child\u2019s best interests remain paramount and must be assessed holistically, including the quality and stability of life with the custodial parent and the preservation of a meaningful relationship with the noncustodial parent. This aligns with the proposition that a modification allowing relocation must support the child\u2019s best interests and ensure welfare and stability under Yannas.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "The words \u201cupon cause shown\u201d mean only that removal must be in the best interests of the child (Rubin v. Rubin, 370 Mass. 857 [1976]; Hale v. Hale, supra at 815), and thus the central question in this case is how these \u201cbest interests\u201d are to be determined. . . . An evaluation of the best interests of the child requires attention to whether the quality of the child\u2019s life may be improved by the change (including any improvement flowing from an improvement in the quality of the custodial parent\u2019s life) . . . and the extent to which moving or not moving will affect the emotional, physical, or developmental needs of the child."
