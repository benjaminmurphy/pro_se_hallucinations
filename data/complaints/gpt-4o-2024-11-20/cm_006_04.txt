**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**MIDDLESEX PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT**  
**Docket No. [INSERT DOCKET NUMBER]**  

**Jessica Thompson,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**Michael Sanders,**  
Defendant,  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, in the above-referenced matter, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court to modify the existing Custody Judgment entered on June 15, 2021, pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, § 28, and for the reasons set forth herein:

---

### **1. Preliminary Statement**

Plaintiff seeks a modification of the Custody Order to protect the best interests of the minor children, Liam Sanders (born April 1, 2017) and Ava Sanders (born September 15, 2019). Since the issuance of the current Custody Order, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances. Specifically, Defendant now resides with a partner who has a criminal history indicative of violent tendencies and presents a safety risk to the children during Defendant's parenting time. The current custody arrangement no longer serves the best interests of the children, and modification is necessary.

---

### **2. Parties**

**Plaintiff:** Jessica Thompson – Resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. As of the existing custody order, Plaintiff is the primary physical custodian of the minor children.  

**Defendant:** Michael Sanders – Resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Defendant has alternate weekend parenting time and one midweek visit under the current order.  

---

### **3. Jurisdiction**

This case falls under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Probate and Family Court pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209C, §§ 3 and 10. Venue is proper in Middlesex County under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223, § 1 and ch. 223A, § 2.

---

### **4. Factual Allegations**

**a. Existing Custody Order:**  
The Custody Order entered on June 15, 2021, grants Plaintiff primary physical custody of the minor children, with Defendant entitled to alternate weekends and one midweek visit.

**b. Material Changes Since the Order:**  

1. **Introduction of Potentially Dangerous Third Party:** Defendant is now cohabiting with a partner who has a documented history of violent conduct. This individual has a criminal record for assault and battery in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, § 13A, as well as a history of being subject to a restraining order under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209A.  

2. **Behavioral Concerns in the Household:** The children have reported to Plaintiff that the individual living with Defendant has engaged in aggressive behavior, including yelling, slamming doors, and grabbing one of the children forcefully enough to leave a visible mark. The Massachusetts Appeals Court has held that courts must consider exposure to violence as a significant factor in custody determinations. See *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590, 597 (1996).  

3. **Involvement of Police:** A neighbor called the police during a loud and aggressive argument in Defendant's household while the children were present, further evidencing an unsafe and unstable environment. See *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488, 494 (2012) ("Courts must consider a child's need for security and stability when reviewing parenting plans.").  

**c. Impact on the Children:** These circumstances pose a substantial risk to the children’s emotional and physical well-being, which constitutes a material change in circumstances warranting modification of the current order under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, § 28, and relevant case law. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 183 (2006) ("A material and substantial change in circumstances must directly implicate the child’s best interests.").

---

### **5. Relief Requested**

In light of the foregoing, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the custody order as follows:  

1. **Restriction of Access by Dangerous Third Parties:** An order barring Defendant’s partner from being present during Defendant’s parenting time. See *Bak v. Bak*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 608, 616 (1987) (acknowledging the court’s authority to impose conditions necessary to protect a child’s welfare).  

2. **Supervised Parenting Time:** If Defendant refuses or is unable to ensure that his partner does not have contact with the children, Plaintiff requests that all parenting time be supervised by a neutral third party approved by the Court. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 842 (2003).  

3. **Other Relief:** Any further relief that this Honorable Court deems just and proper under the circumstances.

---

### **6. Legal Basis for Modification**

Under Massachusetts law, the Court may modify custody orders upon a finding of a material and substantial change in circumstances that affects the best interests of the children. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 208, § 28; *Pizzino v. Miller*, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865, 871 (2006).  

The presence of an individual with a documented history of violence and instability in Defendant’s household constitutes a material change that directly affects the safety, security, and best interests of the children. See *Wilkins v. Wilkins*, 324 Mass. 261, 263 (1949) (holding that a child’s welfare is the primary consideration in custody determinations). Moreover, the Court has broad discretion to impose safeguards necessary to ensure the children’s safety. See *Ginsberg v. Ginsberg*, 429 Mass. 565, 569 (1999).  

Furthermore, Plaintiff’s allegations demonstrate sufficient cause for modification consistent with the Court’s analysis in *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 711 (1985), which emphasizes the importance of conducting a holistic review of the child’s living environment and primary caretaker's ability to provide a safe and nurturing home.

### **7. Certification Pursuant to Rule 5**

I certify, under the penalty of perjury, that I have made a good faith effort to resolve this matter prior to filing this Complaint for Modification, consistent with the requirements of Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 5.

---

### **WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Respectfully Prays:**

(a) That the existing Custody Order be modified to ensure the children’s safety and stability as requested above;  

(b) For such other relief that this Honorable Court deems just and proper.
