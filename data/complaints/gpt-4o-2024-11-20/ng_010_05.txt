### PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

This is a civil action for damages sustained by Plaintiff as a result of Defendant’s negligence in failing to address a known hazardous condition—a visibly cracked and precarious tree branch—that ultimately caused Plaintiff’s injuries. Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages to recover for her physical injuries, medical expenses, lost wages, pain, suffering, and other damages allowed under Massachusetts law.

### PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing in Pittsfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts. 

2. Defendant Robert Smith is, upon information and belief, an individual residing at or owning the property located at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Berkshire County, Massachusetts.

---

### JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to **G.L. c. 212, § 4**, as the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000 and this case involves a civil cause of action arising in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

### FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about July 15, 2023, Plaintiff was walking along the public sidewalk adjacent to 123 Maple Street in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, when a large branch from a maple tree located on Defendant’s property broke and fell on Plaintiff.

6. The branch struck Plaintiff’s shoulder and back, causing her to fall to the ground and sustain significant injuries, including but not limited to a shoulder strain and extensive bruising.

7. The tree branch, which visibly appeared cracked, drooping, and in a hazardous condition prior to the incident, presented a known and foreseeable danger to pedestrians passing along the sidewalk.

8. Upon information and belief, Defendant was informed by neighbors of the hazardous condition of the branch prior to the incident and was advised to address or remove the branch to mitigate the risk of harm.

9. Despite being aware of the dangerous condition of the tree branch, Defendant failed to act with reasonable care in inspecting, addressing, or removing the branch, thereby permitting the dangerous condition to persist.

10. The thunderstorm that occurred on July 15, 2023, was not an extraordinary or unforeseeable weather event, and Defendant’s negligence in failing to address the hazardous branch was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries.

11. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained injuries, incurred medical expenses in the approximate amount of $2,500, and lost wages in the approximate amount of $600. Plaintiff has also suffered pain and emotional distress.

### CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Negligence**

12. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 11 as if fully set forth herein.

13. Under Massachusetts law, property owners owe a duty of reasonable care to those lawfully using adjacent sidewalks to ensure that their property does not present hazardous conditions. (*See* **Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693 (1973).)

14. Defendant breached this duty of care by failing to inspect, repair, or remove the cracked branch, which posed an unreasonable risk of harm to pedestrians. (*See* **Sweeny v. Old Colony & Newport R.R. Co.**, 92 Mass. (10 Allen) 368 (1865).)

15. Defendant’s breach of duty constitutes negligence under Massachusetts law, as he knew or should have known that the cracked branch posed a significant danger. (*See* **Dos Santos v. Coleta**, 465 Mass. 148, 156 (2013).)

16. Defendant’s failure to act was unreasonable given the foreseeable risk of harm to pedestrians such as Plaintiff. (*See* **Poskus v. Lombardo's of Randolph, Inc.**, 423 Mass. 637 (1996).)

17. Defendant’s negligence was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages. (*See* **Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.**, 457 Mass. 368 (2010).)

18. Plaintiff has suffered damages as a result of Defendant’s negligence, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages, pain, and suffering. (*See* **Poirier v. Plymouth**, 374 Mass. 206 (1978).)

### DAMAGES

19. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered the following damages:
   a. Medical expenses of approximately $2,500;  
   b. Lost wages in the approximate amount of $600;  
   c. Physical pain and suffering;  
   d. Emotional distress;  
   e. Additional damages to be proven at trial.

---

### PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant as follows:

1. Entering judgment against Defendant for all damages suffered by Plaintiff as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, including but not limited to:
   a. Compensatory damages for medical expenses, lost wages, pain, suffering, and emotional distress in an amount to be determined at trial;  
   b. Prejudgment interest pursuant to **G.L. c. 231, § 6B**;  
   c. Costs and reasonable attorney’s fees if applicable; and  
   d. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and appropriate.
