The opinion emphasizes that the housing authority may be liable if, despite tenant complaints, it \u201cstood idle\u201d and failed to take relatively easy steps to address the disruptive presence of drug dealers in common areas. This directly aligns with the proposition that landlords must take appropriate steps to address tenant complaints about disruptions interfering with quiet enjoyment.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cIf the defendant has failed to take any measures, especially those measures which can be undertaken relatively easily, to remove unwelcome persons from the property that it owns and controls, and the presence of those persons seriously interferes with the tenancy, then the defendant may be liable for a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. \u2026 Thus, the record suggests that the defendant stood idle, despite continued requests and complaints by the tenants regarding the drug activity on the rented premises.\u201d"

Thus, statutory attorneys\u2019 fees under \u00a7 14 were upheld, but statutory damages for violation of quiet enjoyment were not; the tenant ultimately did not retain a damages award on that count. The proposition overstates what was upheld in Simon v. Solomon.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cIn sum, taking into account the relationships among the three counts of Solomon\u2019s claim, and the instructions that accompanied their submission to the jury, we find no acceptable basis for the verdict awarding $10,000 to Solomon for interference with quiet enjoyment. \u2026 Accordingly, we vacate it. \u2026 After trial, the judge assessed attorneys\u2019 fees of slightly more than $40,000 for Solomon, based on the fee provision of G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14. \u2026 Therefore, Solomon\u2019s claim for emotional distress was within the scope of \u00a7 14, and was properly considered in the determination of attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d"
