Ellard is a concurring opinion discussing the abandonment of common-law entrant classifications (licensee, invitee, trespasser) for premises liability. It does not address tree maintenance, the standard of care regarding a tree branch near a sidewalk, unreasonable risk, or foreseeability based on a visible condition. Therefore, this text does not support the specific proposition about an unreasonable and foreseeable risk from a tree branch adjacent to a public sidewalk.",

But footnote 7 seems to say that 'trespassers' stand apart, that that characterization is to remain decisive or highly influential.\""
