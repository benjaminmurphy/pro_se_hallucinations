v.  

**Michael Johnson,**  
Defendant  

Docket No. ___________  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Lee, and respectfully requests this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody and parenting time order entered by this Court on March 15, 2022. In support of this Complaint, the Plaintiff states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES  

1. Plaintiff, Jessica Lee, resides at [ADDRESS REDACTED] in Norfolk County, Massachusetts. She is the mother of the minor child, Emma Johnson, aged 10.  
2. Defendant, Michael Johnson, resides at [ADDRESS REDACTED] in Norfolk County, Massachusetts. He is the father of the minor child, Emma Johnson.  

---

### II. JURISDICTION  

3. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 209C, § 20, as the original judgment was entered in this Court, the minor child resides in Massachusetts, and jurisdiction remains proper due to the continuing significant relationship between the minor child and both parents.  

---

### III. BACKGROUND  

4. The Judgment of the Norfolk Probate and Family Court issued on March 15, 2022 (the "Original Judgment"), granted the parties shared legal custody of their child, Emma Johnson, age 10, with Plaintiff being designated the primary residential parent.  

5. The Original Judgment also granted Defendant substantial parenting time on alternate weekends, including overnights on Sundays, and required the parties to cooperate on matters of school, including attendance and educational support.  

6. At the time the Original Judgment was entered, the parties' minor child, Emma, was performing reasonably well in school, demonstrating satisfactory academic progress.  

---

### IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

7. Since the entry of the Original Judgment, there has been a significant and material change in circumstances affecting the minor child’s welfare and best interests, particularly regarding her schooling and educational needs.  

8. Defendant has, on numerous occasions, kept Emma home from school on Mondays following his parenting weekends, claiming that she "needs a mental health day." These absences are not supported by medical documentation or recommendations from any professional.  

9. As a result of these absences, Emma has missed significant instructional time and has received one or more truancy warnings from her school. Emma’s grades and standardized test scores have declined markedly over the past year.  

10. Defendant has also regularly failed to bring Emma to her school-mandated or agreed-upon tutoring sessions on weekends falling within his parenting time, despite being fully aware of her academic struggles.  

11. The Defendant’s pattern of conduct is inconsistent with the co-parenting principles outlined in the Original Judgment, including the obligation to prioritize Emma’s educational needs and to cooperate on matters impacting her schooling.  

12. Plaintiff has made multiple attempts to address these issues with Defendant, including written communication and requests for mediation, but Defendant has failed to take corrective action or work in good faith to resolve these ongoing issues.  

13. Emma’s continued educational struggles and absenteeism are having a cumulative negative impact on her academic development and emotional well-being, and it is in her best interests to modify the existing custody arrangement to address these concerns.  

---

### V. APPLICABLE LEGAL PRINCIPLES AND RELIEF REQUESTED  

14. Under Massachusetts law, a custody order may be modified where a "material and substantial change in circumstances" has occurred such that a modification is in the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).  

15. The Court’s primary obligation in custody matters is to determine and promote the best interests of the child. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).  

16. A significant decline in academic performance and school attendance as a direct result of a parent’s conduct constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances warranting modification of a custody arrangement. See El Chaar v. Chehab, 78 Mass. App. Ct. 501 (2010).  

17. The Court has recognized that stable, consistent school attendance is a critical component of a child’s best interests. See Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996).  

18. Shared legal custody requires parents to engage in cooperative decision-making on important issues such as education. A breakdown in this cooperation or a failure to adequately support the child's educational needs may justify modification. See Blixt v. Blixt, 437 Mass. 649 (2002).  

19. The Plaintiff’s proposed modification, which would grant her final decision-making authority regarding educational matters and adjust parenting time to minimize school-night overnights, is reasonable, narrowly tailored, and necessary to address the substantial change in circumstances and to serve Emma’s best interests.  

20. Massachusetts courts have broad discretion to fashion modifications to custody and parenting time arrangements that are consistent with the child's best interests. See Custody of Zia, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 237 (2000).  

---

### VI. SPECIFIC RELIEF REQUESTED  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Modify the Judgment of March 15, 2022, to grant Plaintiff, Jessica Lee, sole legal decision-making authority over all educational matters, including school attendance and academic support services.  
2. Amend Defendant’s parenting time to remove or reduce Sunday overnights, ensuring that the minor child is consistently prepared for and attends school on Mondays.  
3. Include language explicitly requiring both parties to ensure Emma’s attendance at all school and academic support activities, including tutoring, unless excused by her school or a medical professional.  
4. Grant such other relief as this Court deems fair, just, and proper under the circumstances.  

Respectfully submitted,  
Plaintiff,
