6. While shopping in the dairy aisle of the store, Plaintiff stepped into a visible puddle of spilled milk on the floor.  
7. The puddle was substantial and had been traversed by shopping cart wheels, further spreading the liquid across the floor.  
8. No warning signs, cones, or similar warnings were placed in the area to alert customers of the hazardous condition.  
9. A store employee was stocking shelves approximately fifteen feet from the spill and admitted he had noticed the spill “a few minutes ago” but had not yet taken steps to clean it or to warn customers.  
10. As a result of stepping into the milk puddle, Plaintiff slipped and fell forcefully onto her left hip.  
11. Initially believing her injuries were minor, Plaintiff completed her shopping. Later that evening, Plaintiff began experiencing severe pain in her hip.  
12. On September 17, 2023, Plaintiff sought medical attention at an urgent care facility, where she was diagnosed with a hip sprain.  
13. Plaintiff was prescribed physical therapy as part of her recovery and incurred medical bills amounting to $1,200.  
14. Plaintiff was unable to work her regular shifts at her café job, resulting in lost wages of approximately $800.  
15. Defendant had a duty to maintain its property in a safe condition, including the duty to identify and remedy unsafe conditions such as the spilled milk on its floor.  
16. Defendant breached its duty of care by failing to promptly clean the hazardous condition or to warn Plaintiff and other customers of its presence.

22. Defendant’s negligence was the proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries. (**Vaughan v. Webber**, 400 Mass. 575, 578 (1987)).  
23. Defendant’s breach of duty caused Plaintiff to suffer physical injuries, medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering. (**Ulwick v. DeChristopher**, 411 Mass. 401, 407 (1991)).
