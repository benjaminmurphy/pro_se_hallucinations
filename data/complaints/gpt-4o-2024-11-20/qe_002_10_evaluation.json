L. c. 186, \u00a7 14\u2026 [Gem] violated its underlying duty to maintain sanitary conditions in her apartment, and thereby permitted repeated flooding to occur that interfered with her quiet enjoyment of her apartment.\u201d"

The court affirms an award of treble damages under c. 93A for intentional infliction of emotional distress and breach of the warranty of habitability, and separately discusses c. 186 only as to retaliation (c. 186, \u00a7 18) and quiet enjoyment, without addressing \u00a7 14\u2019s treble-damages remedy or setting any standard for \u201cwillful\u201d conduct under that section. Thus, it does not support the specific proposition that it interprets or applies treble damages under G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 14 for willful landlord conduct.",

The judge later added to this award, an award of attorneys' fees and costs.\n...\nWe conclude that, in appropriate circumstances, tenants may recover multiple damages for the intentional infliction of emotional distress under c. 93A."

The opinion expressly rejects a strict malfeasance/nonfeasance distinction in such circumstances, making it clear that failure to act to correct known, controllable substantial interferences can result in landlord liability.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThere are occasions, however, where a landlord has not intended to violate a tenant\u2019s rights, but there was nevertheless a breach of the landlord\u2019s covenant of quiet enjoyment which flowed as the natural and probable consequence of what the landlord did, what he failed to do, or what he permitted to be done\u2026 Because the disturbing condition was the natural and probable consequence of the landlords\u2019 permitting the lounge to operate where it did and because the landlords could control the actions at the lounge, they should not be entitled to collect rent\u2026 To the extent that our opinions suggest a distinction between nonfeasance\u2026 and malfeasance\u2026 we decline to perpetuate that distinction where the landlord creates a situation and has the right to control the objectionable conditions.\u201d"

It analyzes ownership, mortgage foreclosure by peaceable entry, and the effect on legal and equitable title; it does not address landlord\u2011tenant law, tenant complaints, retaliation, or the covenant of quiet enjoyment. Therefore it cannot be authority for the proposition that retaliation for tenant complaints violates the covenant of quiet enjoyment.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Application of those basic principles means that on February 16,1996, when Alba purported to assign the mortgage to Sylvan, there simply was no mortgage to assign. More than three years had passed since Alba filed the certificate of peaceable entry. The equity of redemption was gone and with it the mortgage. At that point, Alba owned the property in fee."

It does not interpret G.L. c. 186, does not involve landlord-tenant law, retaliation, or substantial interference, and contains no discussion of remedies under that chapter. Citing this case for remedies in retaliation and substantial interference cases under G.L. c. 186 is inaccurate.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Because the plaintiffs have now resumed their employment, a declaration of this court would not have an immediate impact on their employment rights. The plaintiffs now assert that they sustained a loss of employment benefits including *1008 approximately three months\u2019 pay. In their complaint, however, they sought only injunctive relief and a declaration that the action and order of the Chief Administrative Justice was unlawful. They made no claim for damages based on loss of pay. The questions raised by the complaint have become moot."
