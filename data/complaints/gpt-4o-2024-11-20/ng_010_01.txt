**INTRODUCTION**  

This is a civil action for personal injuries sustained by the Plaintiff, Emily Carter, resulting from Defendant John Thompson's negligence in failing to properly maintain his property and to address an obviously hazardous condition that he had prior notice of, causing Plaintiff to suffer significant injuries, damages, and financial losses.  

**PARTIES**  

1. Plaintiff Emily Carter ("Plaintiff") is an individual residing at 45 Walker Road, Pittsfield, Massachusetts, 01201.  
2. Defendant John Thompson ("Defendant") is an individual who owns and resides at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts, 01201.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4 as the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000, and the Court has general jurisdiction over tort claims arising under Massachusetts law.  
4. Venue is proper in the Berkshire County Division of the Superior Court Department under G.L. c. 223, § 1, as the incident giving rise to this action occurred in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, which lies within Berkshire County.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

5. At all relevant times, Defendant John Thompson owned and controlled real property located at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts (the "Property").  
6. On or before August 12, 2023, a large, visibly drooping, cracked branch of a maple tree located on the Property (the "Hazardous Branch") extended over a public pedestrian sidewalk.  
7. Plaintiff resides in the neighborhood and habitually walked on the sidewalk in front of the Property as part of her normal routine.  
8. At all relevant times, Defendant was aware or should have been aware of the condition of the Hazardous Branch, which was known by neighbors and clearly visible to passersby.  
9. Neighbors explicitly alerted Defendant to the Hazardous Branch and recommended he consult an arborist to address the risk it posed.  
10. Defendant admitted to neighbors that he was aware of the Hazardous Branch and stated he would "deal with it in the spring."  
11. Defendant failed to act within a reasonable time to inspect, maintain, or remove the Hazardous Branch, despite knowing it created a foreseeable risk of harm to pedestrians using the sidewalk.  
12. On August 12, 2023, during a routine summer thunderstorm with moderate wind and rain, the Hazardous Branch snapped and fell directly onto Plaintiff as she walked on the sidewalk, carrying grocery bags.  
13. The falling branch struck Plaintiff on her shoulder and back, knocking her to the ground and causing physical injuries.  
14. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained a shoulder strain, multiple bruises, and substantial physical pain and discomfort.  
15. Plaintiff sought and received medical treatment for her injuries, incurring approximately $1,200 in medical expenses.  
16. Plaintiff was unable to work for approximately one week at her retail job, resulting in lost wages of approximately $650.  
17. Plaintiff’s injuries also caused her physical pain, emotional distress, and interference with her daily activities.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  

**Negligence**  

18. Plaintiff restates and incorporates by reference the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 17 as if fully set forth herein.  
19. Under Massachusetts law, property owners owe a duty of reasonable care to lawful pedestrians using sidewalks adjacent to their property, to prevent unreasonable risks of harm by addressing hazardous conditions on their property. *See Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368 (2010); *Sweeney v. Old Colony & Newport R.R. Co.*, 10 Allen 368, 373 (Mass. 1865).  
20. Defendant breached this duty of care by failing to inspect, maintain, or remove the Hazardous Branch, which he knew or should have known posed an unreasonable risk of harm to pedestrians.  
21. Defendant's failure to remedy the unsafe condition of the Hazardous Branch constitutes negligence. *See Young v. Garwacki*, 380 Mass. 162, 169 (1980); *Poirier v. Plymouth*, 374 Mass. 206, 210 (1978).  
22. Defendant had actual knowledge of the Hazardous Branch’s unsafe condition, as neighbors alerted him to the issue and the condition of the branch was open and obvious. *See Cimino v. Milford Keg, Inc.*, 385 Mass. 323, 327 (1982); *Barry v. Beverly Enterprises-Massachusetts, Inc.*, 418 Mass. 590, 593 (1994).  
23. Plaintiff’s injuries and damages were the direct and foreseeable result of Defendant's negligent conduct, as a property owner exercising reasonable care would have addressed the dangerous condition prior to its causing harm. *See Leary v. Am. Airline, Inc.*, 484 F. Supp. 2d 47, 54 (D. Mass. 2007); *Scott v. Garfield*, 454 Mass. 790, 796 (2009).  

**DAMAGES**  

24. As a direct and proximate result of the Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered the following damages:  
   a. Medical expenses in the amount of approximately $1,200;  
   b. Lost wages in the amount of approximately $650;  
   c. Physical pain and suffering;  
   d. Emotional distress; and  
   e. Diminished enjoyment of life.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment against Defendant John Thompson and grant the following relief:  
1. Compensatory damages in an amount that this Court determines to be fair and just, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering;  
2. Pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as provided by law;  
3. Costs and expenses of this action; and  
4. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.  

**DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL**  

Pursuant to Rule 38 of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,  

**Emily Carter,**
