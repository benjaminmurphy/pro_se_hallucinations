The rest of the opinion concerns whether there was sufficient evidence of breach and notice, but the duty rule itself is clearly articulated.",

Instead, it critiques the continued use of common-law status categories (trespasser, licensee, invitee). While the main Mounsey opinion does address occupiers\u2019 duties, nothing in this excerpt establishes or affirms the specific business\u2011invitee duty stated in the proposition.",

Instead, the court holds that under the newly adopted mode-of-operation approach, the store is deemed to have notice of risks inherent in its self-service produce operation, without requiring proof of actual or constructive notice of the particular grape on the floor. There is no support here for the narrower proposition that employees\u2019 statements evidenced actual or constructive notice of a specific puddle in a hallway.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cIn sum, the adoption of the mode of operation approach will not modify the general rule governing premises liability requiring a plaintiff to prove that an owner had either actual or constructive notice of an unsafe condition on the premises. However, if a plaintiff proves that an unsafe condition on an owner\u2019s premises exists that was reasonably foreseeable, resulting from an owner\u2019s self-service business or mode of operation, and the plaintiff slips as a result of the unsafe condition, the plaintiff will satisfy the notice requirement.\u201d"

It does not involve premises liability, hazards, remedial measures, or any duty to remedy a dangerous condition after notice. Therefore it does not provide authority for the proposition about a defendant\u2019s failure to take remedial action after acquiring knowledge of a hazard.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Nor is it to be readily assumed that the Legislature intended that a board consisting of one State constitutional officer and two commissioners of departments should be subordinated to the courts in its determination of this sort of question.

It does not involve premises liability or a failure to maintain physical premises in a safe condition; the unsafe conduct is overserving alcohol, not a hazardous condition on the land. Therefore, it does not support a proposition about foreseeability of injuries arising from failure to maintain premises safely.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cIt is only necessary for the plaintiff to prove that the defendant took a risk with respect to the plaintiff\u2019s safety that a person of ordinary prudence would not have taken, and that the plaintiff suffered a resulting injury that was within the foreseeable risk. \u2026 Therefore, evidence that a tavern keeper served intoxicating liquor to a patron the tavern keeper knew, or reasonably should have known, was intoxicated is sufficient to warrant a jury finding that the tavern keeper took such a risk, and that injuries to a highway traveler \u2026 were proximately caused by the tavern keeper\u2019s negligent act.\u201d"
