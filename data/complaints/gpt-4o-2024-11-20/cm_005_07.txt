**EMILY JOHNSON**,  
   Plaintiff,  
   v.  
**MICHAEL SMITH**,  
   Defendant.  
_________________________________________  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

**NOW COMES THE PLAINTIFF, Emily Johnson, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and Massachusetts Rules of Domestic Relations Procedure Rule 7(b), and respectfully seeks a modification of the custody arrangement entered by this Court on May 14, 2021. Plaintiff asserts that a material change in circumstances has occurred warranting a modification in the best interests of the minor children, Liam Smith (age 10) and Ava Smith (age 8). In support of this Complaint, the Plaintiff states as follows:**  

---

### **1. THE PARTIES**

1. Plaintiff, **Emily Johnson**, currently resides at [Address Withheld for Privacy] and is the mother of the minor children, Liam Smith (born [DOB]) and Ava Smith (born [DOB]).  
2. Defendant, **Michael Smith**, currently resides at [Address Withheld] and is the father of the minor children.

---

### **2. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**

3. On **May 14, 2021**, this Court entered a Judgment of Custody and Visitation, awarding the parties **shared legal custody** of the minor children. The judgment specified that the children primarily reside with the Plaintiff and that the Defendant exercise parenting time on a regular schedule.  
4. The Court ordered that both parents shall facilitate and encourage the children’s relationship with the other parent and avoid disparaging remarks about the other parent in the presence of the children.

---

### **3. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

5. Since the entry of the current order, there have been significant changes in circumstances affecting the minor children’s welfare and necessitating a reassessment of the custody arrangement:

   a. The Defendant has repeatedly **enrolled the minor children in extracurricular activities during the Plaintiff’s parenting time** without consent or prior discussion with the Plaintiff, in contravention of the principles of shared legal custody.  
   
   b. The Defendant has **undermined the Plaintiff’s relationship with the minor children** by making disparaging remarks about the Plaintiff in the presence of the children, including telling the children that the Plaintiff is "selfish" and "does not really love them."  

   c. One of the children, Liam, has begun experiencing physical symptoms of stress, including stomach aches, on transition days between households.  

   d. The Defendant has created unnecessary conflict regarding the parenting schedule by blaming the Plaintiff in front of the children when she is unable to accommodate requested weekend changes related to unscheduled activities.

6. These behaviors materially impact the emotional well-being of the minor children and interfere with the Plaintiff’s ability to meaningfully co-parent with the Defendant.

### **4. RELEVANT LAW AND BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN**

7. Massachusetts law entrusts Probate and Family Courts with the discretionary authority to modify custody orders where there has been a **"material and substantial change in circumstances"** and where modification is in the **"best interests of the child."** G.L. c. 208, § 28; _Bouchard v. Bouchard_, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).  

8. The best interests of the minor children remain the paramount concern in custody disputes. _Raymond v. Raymond_, 165 Mass. 573 (1896); _Foley v. Foley_, 27 Mass. App. Ct. 221, 226 (1989).  

9. Courts must consider whether one parent is interfering with the children’s relationship with the other parent when determining the best interest of the child. _Harris v. Harris_, 23 Mass. App. Ct. 931 (1986).  

10. Shared legal custody requires that parents communicate effectively and make joint decisions in the children’s interests. Where such cooperation is lacking, sole legal custody may be appropriate. _Rolde v. Rolde_, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404 (1981); _Doe v. Doe_, 16 Mass. App. Ct. 499 (1983).  

11. In _Hunter v. Rose_, 463 Mass. 488 (2012), the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court recognized that stability and reduced conflict are crucial to children’s emotional health and development.  

12. Excessive parental conflict and disparagement in front of children have been found to justify modifications to custody arrangements. _Smith v. McDonald_, 458 Mass. 540 (2010).  

13. In light of the Defendant’s actions, including unilateral decision-making, disparaging comments, failure to co-parent effectively, and the emotional harm to the minor children, modification of the current custody arrangement is warranted.  

---

### **5. REQUESTED RELIEF**

14. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court issue an order modifying the prior custody judgment as follows:

   a. That the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, be granted **sole legal custody** of the minor children, as the Defendant’s actions demonstrate an inability to engage in meaningful and effective communication required by shared legal custody.  
   
   b. That the minor children primarily reside with the Plaintiff, with parenting time for the Defendant to be adjusted accordingly and clarified by a specific written schedule.  

   c. That the Court order both parties to refrain from making disparaging comments about the other parent in the presence of the children, pursuant to _Rosenberg v. Merida_, 428 Mass. 182 (1998).  

   d. That the Court require the Defendant to obtain Plaintiff’s consent before enrolling the minor children in any extracurricular activities that interfere with Plaintiff’s parenting time.  

   e. Any additional or alternative relief the Court deems just and proper.
