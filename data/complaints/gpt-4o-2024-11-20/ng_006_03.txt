**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**SUFFOLK COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT**  

**Jordan Mills,**  
   Plaintiff,  
v.  
**Alex Johnson,**  
   Defendant.  

Civil Action No. [Leave Blank for Court Use]  

**COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND**  

**INTRODUCTION**  
1. This is a negligence action to recover damages for injuries sustained by Plaintiff Jordan Mills when Defendant Alex Johnson carelessly and negligently opened the door of his vehicle into a marked bike lane, causing Plaintiff to collide with the door, suffer injuries, and incur financial losses.  

**PARTIES**  
2. Plaintiff Jordan Mills is an individual residing in Boston, Massachusetts.  
3. Defendant Alex Johnson is an individual residing in or doing business in Massachusetts.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, as the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000.  
5. Venue is proper in Suffolk County pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1, because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Boston, Massachusetts.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
6. On June 15, 2023, Plaintiff Jordan Mills was lawfully riding his bicycle in a marked bike lane near the address of 1234 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts.  
7. Plaintiff was wearing a helmet, following all applicable traffic laws and regulations, and traveling safely and predictably in the bike lane when the incident occurred.  
8. Defendant Alex Johnson had parked his vehicle in a designated loading zone adjacent to the bike lane.  
9. Without checking his surroundings, including his mirrors and blind spot, Defendant suddenly opened the driver-side door of his vehicle directly into the bike lane as Plaintiff was passing.  
10. Plaintiff had no time to avoid the door and collided with it at full speed, causing him to be thrown from his bike onto the pavement.  
11. At the scene, Defendant admitted he “didn’t see” Plaintiff because he was looking at his phone.  
12. As a result of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff suffered road rash on both arms and legs, a chipped front tooth, and damage to his bicycle, leaving its frame bent and rendering it unusable.  
13. Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,500 in medical expenses for treatment of his injuries, including dental work for his chipped tooth.  
14. Plaintiff also incurred lost wages of approximately $800 due to missing work while recovering from his injuries.  
15. Plaintiff was forced to replace his ruined bicycle at a cost of $1,200.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**Count I – Negligence**  
16. Plaintiff restates and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through 15.  
17. Under Massachusetts law, every person has a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid causing foreseeable injuries to others. See *Graham v. M.J. Corp.*, 431 Mass. 16, 18 (2000).  
18. Pursuant to G.L. c. 90, § 14, it is unlawful for a driver or passenger to open a car door into traffic, including bike lanes, without first ensuring that it is safe to do so, commonly referred to as the “dooring” law.  
19. Defendant breached his duty of care by failing to check for approaching bicyclists and heed his statutory obligation under G.L. c. 90, § 14 before opening his car door.  
20. Defendant’s careless and inattentive actions, including his admitted distraction while looking at his phone, constitute a failure to act as a reasonably prudent person would under similar circumstances. See *Michalik v. Michalik*, 380 Mass. 370, 372 (1980).  
21. But for Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff would not have been struck by the vehicle door, thrown from his bicycle, and injured. See *Poskus v. Lombardo's of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637, 638 (1996).  
22. Defendant’s actions were the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries, losses, and damages, as the injuries were a foreseeable result of opening a car door without ensuring it was safe to do so. See *Levy v. Blistein*, 35 Mass. App. Ct. 684, 686 (1993).  
23. Plaintiff has suffered damages, including physical pain, emotional distress, medical expenses, lost wages, and property damage, as a result of Defendant’s negligence. See *Rodriguez v. Cambridge Housing Auth.*, 443 Mass. 697, 701 (2005).  

**DAMAGES**  
24. Plaintiff has incurred the following damages as a result of Defendant’s negligence:  
    a. Approximately $1,500 in medical expenses;  
    b. Approximately $800 in lost wages;  
    c. Approximately $1,200 for the replacement of Plaintiff’s damaged bicycle;  
    d. Pain and suffering related to road rash injuries and a chipped tooth; and  
    e. Emotional distress caused by the sudden and traumatic nature of the incident.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jordan Mills respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in his favor and grant the following relief:  
1. An award of damages in the amount to be determined at trial but not less than $50,000, including compensation for medical expenses, lost wages, property damage, and pain and suffering;  
2. Prejudgment and post-judgment interest as permitted by law;  
3. Costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in this action, to the extent recoverable by law; and  
4. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

**JURY DEMAND**  
Pursuant to Rule 38 of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

**Respectfully submitted,**
