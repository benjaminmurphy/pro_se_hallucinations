   Plaintiff,  

v.  

**Michael Reed,**  
   Defendant.  
____________________________________  
**Docket No.: ________**  
**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Laura Thompson, in the above-captioned matter, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court to modify the Judgment of Divorce entered on March 15, 2021, regarding custody and parenting time of the minor child, Emily Reed. As grounds for her Complaint, the Plaintiff states as follows:

### **PARTIES**

1. Plaintiff, Laura Thompson, is the mother of Emily Reed, a minor child aged 10, and resides in Fall River, Massachusetts.  
2. Defendant, Michael Reed, is the father of Emily Reed and resides in New Bedford, Massachusetts.   

### **JURISDICTION**

3. This Honorable Court has jurisdiction over this matter under G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 209C, § 20.  
4. Venue is proper in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court as both parties reside within this county.   

### **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5. On or about March 15, 2021, this Court entered a Judgment of Divorce that, among other provisions, awarded shared legal custody of Emily Reed to Plaintiff and Defendant. Plaintiff was designated the primary residential parent, and Defendant was awarded substantial parenting time, including overnight Sundays.  
6. Pursuant to the original judgment, both parties were ordered to cooperate on matters relating to Emily's education and provide each other with critical information necessary to foster Emily’s academic and personal well-being.  
7. When the original custody judgment was entered, Emily was thriving in school, with satisfactory grades, participation in extracurricular activities, and consistent attendance.  
8. Over the past year, Defendant has repeatedly failed to ensure that Emily attends school on the Mondays following his weekend parenting time. Defendant justifies Emily’s absences by stating she “needs a mental health day.” However, no supporting documentation or recommendations from medical or mental health professionals have been provided to substantiate these absences.  
9. Emily’s school attendance records indicate a significant pattern of unexcused absences, which has triggered truancy warnings from her school.  
10. As a result of her prolonged absences, Emily’s academic performance has declined, with her grades falling below the standards she previously met, and her standardized test scores have decreased.  
11. Defendant has also demonstrated a pattern of failing to bring Emily to scheduled tutoring sessions that coincide with his parenting time, further impeding her academic progress.  
12. Efforts by Plaintiff to address this pattern with Defendant, including attempts to work cooperatively as required by the existing Judgment of Divorce, have been unsuccessful. Defendant refuses to acknowledge the connection between Emily’s absences and her declining academic performance and continues to withhold Emily from school despite warnings from the school system.  
13. Emily’s educational welfare has been materially and adversely affected by Defendant’s actions, constituting a significant and material change in circumstances since the entry of the original custody arrangement.  

### **APPLICABLE LAW**

14. Massachusetts law provides that a custody or parenting arrangement may be modified upon a material and substantial change in circumstances that affects the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012).  
15. Courts have consistently held that the best interests of the child must guide modifications of custody orders. *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 710 (1985).  
16. A child’s academic success and consistent education have long been recognized as central to the best interests of the child. *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404 (1981).  
17. Parental cooperation is essential in shared legal custody arrangements. Where cooperation breaks down in ways that adversely affect the child, modification is appropriate. See *Hunter*, 463 Mass. at 494; *Hoard v. Hoard*, 15 Mass. App. Ct. 710, 712 (1983).  
18. Massachusetts courts have held that regular school attendance is a fundamental obligation of parents and material to a child’s well-being. *Williams v. Massa*, 431 Mass. 619, 624 (2000).  
19. Defendant’s failure to prioritize Emily’s educational needs violates basic principles of shared legal custody and materially affects her best interests. *Kendall v. Kendall*, 426 Mass. 238, 243 (1997).  
20. This Court has wide discretion to restructure parenting time in cases where one parent’s actions negatively impact the child’s education. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 185 (2006); *Rosenberg v. Merida*, 428 Mass. 182, 184-85 (1998).  
21. A pattern of unilateral decision-making that harms the child’s welfare constitutes grounds for modifying an existing custody order. *Schechter v. Schechter*, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239, 243 (2015).  
22. Safety, stability, and educational consistency constitute compelling reasons for revisiting and amending custody arrangements as per the best interests of the child. *Blixt v. Blixt*, 437 Mass. 649, 656 (2002); *Furtado v. Furtado*, 380 Mass. 137 (1980).  

### **REQUESTED RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Laura Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  
1. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the Judgment of Divorce on or about March 15, 2021.  
2. Modify the parenting schedule and award Plaintiff sole decision-making authority regarding school attendance decisions.  
3. Adjust the Defendant’s parenting schedule to reduce or eliminate overnights when school attendance or academic obligations are adversely affected.  
4. Grant such other relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper.
