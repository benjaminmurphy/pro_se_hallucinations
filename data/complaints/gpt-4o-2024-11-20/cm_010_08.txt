CIVIL ACTION NO: ___________  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**

---

### **INTRODUCTION**  

1. This Complaint is brought under G.L. c. 208, § 28, which authorizes the court to modify a prior custody determination when there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances and such modification serves the best interests of the child.  

2. Plaintiff is the mother of Sophia Johnson (“Sophia”), born on November 20, 2015, and seeks modification of the parenting schedule established by the custody order entered on May 15, 2016, by this Honorable Court.  

3. The Plaintiff submits this request for modification to allow Sophia to spend increased parenting time with her mother in accordance with her best interests.

### **JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 209B, § 2, as both parents and the minor child reside within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  

5. Venue is proper as this matter arises within the jurisdiction of the Bristol County Probate and Family Court.

### **FACTUAL BACKGROUND**  

**The Original Custody Order**  
6. On May 15, 2016, this Court issued an order granting primary physical custody of Sophia to Defendant, Michael Johnson ("Defendant"), with Plaintiff receiving limited parenting time consisting of weekend visits and one weeknight dinner.  

7. The original custody order was based on Plaintiff's circumstances at that time, specifically her completion of graduate school, lack of stable housing, and limited flexibility in her schedule.  

**Material Change in Circumstances**  
8. Since the issuance of the original custody order, there have been substantial and material changes in the circumstances of Plaintiff and the minor child, which justify a modification of custody under G.L. c. 208, § 28.  

   a. Plaintiff has completed her graduate education and now works full-time with a stable and predictable schedule.  
   
   b. Plaintiff has secured a suitable two-bedroom apartment where Sophia has her own private room.  
   
   c. Plaintiff has established a significantly stronger parental relationship with Sophia, and they have bonded closely during Plaintiff's parenting time.  

   d. Sophia, now age 10, has expressed her wish to spend more time with her mother. Her therapist has noted that she feels increased emotional stress and guilt due to the limited parenting time she currently has with Plaintiff.  

   e. Sophia has written a letter to the Court reiterating her desire to spend more overnights with her mother, emphasizing her comfort and joy in Plaintiff’s home.  

   f. Defendant has refused to discuss any adjustments to the parenting schedule, creating tension and emotional stress for Sophia.  

**The Child’s Best Interests**  
9. The modification of custody is in the best interests of Sophia and aligns with the principles outlined in G.L. c. 208, § 31, and G.L. c. 209C, ensuring her physical, emotional, and developmental well-being.  

10. Due to her age and maturity, Sophia is now better able to articulate her feelings about her living arrangements. The Court has recognized the importance of giving weight to the reasonable preferences of older children in custody determinations. See *Bak v. Bak*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 608, 612 (1987).  

---

### **LEGAL GROUNDS FOR MODIFICATION**  

11. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, a modification in custody orders is justified when there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances. 

12. Case law consistently reinforces the principle that modifications may be warranted when the established custody arrangement no longer serves the best interests of the child. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834, 847 (2003); *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488, 494 (2012).  

13. Factors considered in determining the best interests of the child include the child’s need for stability, adjustment to home, and emotional well-being. See *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 710-711 (1985); *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404 (1981).  

14. A party seeking modification must demonstrate that the current living situation is no longer in the child's best interests. See *Schaffer v. Schaffer*, 43 Mass. App. Ct. 743, 748 (1997).  

15. The evidence demonstrates that the limited parenting time granted to Plaintiff in 2016 is no longer appropriate due to her improved circumstances and the evolving needs of the child. See *Hale v. Hale*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 812, 819 (1981).  

16. Sophia's expressed desire to increase her time with Plaintiff also merits considerable weight as a child’s preferences are a valid factor in custody determinations. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 186 (2006); *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 261 (2001).  

17. Courts must prioritize a parenting plan that maximizes the time and relationship with both parents when feasible. See *Williams v. Massa*, 431 Mass. 619, 621 (2000).  

18. Defendant’s refusal to cooperate and inability to address Sophia’s emotional needs further highlights the importance of modification. See *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590, 598 (1996).

### **REQUEST FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the prior custody order of May 15, 2016;  

2. Modify the existing custody order to grant Plaintiff increased parenting time with the parties’ minor child, Sophia Johnson, including but not limited to additional overnights with Plaintiff;  

3. Issue an updated custody schedule that reflects the best interests of Sophia Johnson;  

4. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,  
**Emily Johnson, Plaintiff**
