**IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

6. On or about September 12, 2023, at approximately 8:00 a.m., the Plaintiff, Mark Johnson, was riding his bicycle to work in the designated bike lane on Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts, near the address of 55 Commonwealth Avenue.  

7. The bike lane in question was clearly marked, and the Plaintiff was proceeding in a lawful and prudent manner, fully complying with applicable traffic laws and safety practices, including wearing a helmet.  

8. At the same time, the Defendant, Ryan Smith, was parked in a marked loading zone directly adjacent to the bike lane on Commonwealth Avenue.  

9. As the Plaintiff was properly traveling in the marked bike lane, the Defendant, without warning and without exercising reasonable care, abruptly opened his driver-side door into the path of the Plaintiff’s bicycle.

10. The Plaintiff had no reasonable opportunity to avoid the collision and struck the Defendant’s door, causing him to be thrown from his bicycle and onto the pavement.  

11. As a result of the collision, the Plaintiff suffered serious personal injuries, including, but not limited to, road rash on his arms and legs, a chipped front tooth, and damage to personal property, including his bicycle, which sustained a bent frame rendering it unrepairable.  

12. At the scene, the Defendant admitted fault, stating that he “didn’t see” the Plaintiff because he was preoccupied with checking his phone.  

13. Despite the Defendant’s admission, when the Plaintiff filed a claim with the Defendant’s insurance company, the Defendant alleged that the Plaintiff was “weaving in and out of traffic,” a statement that is patently false and contradicted by the facts.  

14. The Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,500 in medical expenses, $500 in lost wages, and over $800 in property damage due to the collision.  

15. The Plaintiff continues to suffer physical pain, emotional distress, and financial hardship as a result of the Defendant’s negligent conduct.

**V. CAUSE OF ACTION: NEGLIGENCE**  

16. The Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  

17. Under Massachusetts law, the Defendant owed the Plaintiff a duty of reasonable care, including but not limited to the duty to ensure that opening his vehicle door could be done safely and without endangering other lawful road users, such as bicyclists. See M.G.L. c. 90, § 14.  

18. The Defendant breached his duty of care by:  
   a. Failing to check for oncoming bicyclists before opening his door;  
   b. Failing to ensure that it was safe to open his door into an active bike lane; and  
   c. Engaging in distracted activity, including the use of his phone, immediately prior to opening the door.  

19. The Defendant’s breach of duty was the direct and proximate cause of the Plaintiff’s injuries, damages, and losses.  

20. Under Massachusetts caselaw, a driver opening a car door into a bicyclist’s lawful path constitutes actionable negligence. See *Dube v. Keogh*, 201 Mass. 347 (1909) (finding liability where a driver opens a door in an unsafe manner and causes injury).  

21. The Defendant’s negligence violated Massachusetts General Laws, including but not limited to M.G.L. c. 90, § 14, which requires drivers to open doors with reasonable caution to prevent collisions with other lawful road users such as bicyclists.  

22. The Plaintiff’s injuries, including but not limited to physical injuries, property damage, medical expenses, and lost wages, were foreseeable and directly caused by the Defendant’s failure to meet his duty of care.

**VI. DAMAGES**  

23. As a direct and proximate result of the Defendant’s negligence, the Plaintiff has suffered the following damages:  
   a. Medical expenses in the amount of approximately $1,500;  
   b. Lost wages in the amount of approximately $500;  
   c. Costs of repairing or replacing property, including a bicycle, in the amount of approximately $800;  
   d. Physical pain, suffering, and emotional distress; and  
   e. Other economic and non-economic damages to be determined at trial.  

24. The Plaintiff is entitled to recover compensatory damages for the aforementioned losses, as well as interest, costs, and attorney’s fees, pursuant to Massachusetts law.  

---

**VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grant the following relief:  
1. Enter judgment in favor of the Plaintiff and against the Defendant;  
2. Award the Plaintiff compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages, property damage, pain and suffering, and emotional distress;  
3. Award the Plaintiff interest, costs, and reasonable attorney’s fees as permitted by law; and  
4. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

The Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all claims and issues so triable.
