Ellard is the landmark Massachusetts case abolishing the invitee/licensee distinction and imposing a general duty of reasonable care owed by landowners to all lawful visitors. While the excerpt provided is a concurrence focusing on treatment of trespassers, the case as a whole supports the proposition that Massachusetts common law requires property owners to exercise reasonable care, including to warn or remedy known hazards, toward lawful entrants. The specific quoted passage doesn\u2019t restate that rule, but it is part of an opinion whose holding does establish it.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "We now hold that the common law distinctions between licensees and invitees should be abolished. We further hold that henceforth in this Commonwealth the occupier of land owes a duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors. The test is whether in the management of his property the occupier has acted as a reasonable man in view of the probability of injury to others, including the duty to warn of or to remedy dangers of which he knows or reasonably should know."

The court further emphasizes that once a property owner undertakes snow and ice removal, the conduct is judged under the same reasonable care standard, including liability for negligent removal efforts. This directly supports the proposition that Massachusetts law recognizes potential liability for injuries resulting from negligent snow removal under the Papadopoulos reasonable care standard.",

The case thus rejects, rather than affirms, a claim that the defendant\u2019s actions or omissions violated Massachusetts law on these facts. It cannot fairly be cited as authority that the defendant\u2019s conduct was unlawful; it is authority for the opposite conclusion under the Mounsey/Toubiana framework.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cAfter reviewing the evidence presented at the first trial, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict should have been allowed because the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, was not sufficient to warrant an inference that the defendant violated the duty of reasonable care that it owed to the plaintiff. \u2026 In sum, the jury could not reasonably have inferred that the defendant violated its duty of reasonable care by failing to remove the ice or to warn the plaintiff of a potential hazard.\u201d"
