The cited page discusses adverse employment action and retaliation standards, not a general duty of reasonable care regarding property. Therefore, this opinion does not support the stated proposition about a defendant\u2019s duty to maintain property safely.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"The fatal defect in MacCormack\u2019s claim is that he failed to prove that Boston Edison took any action against him at all which was substantial enough to count as the kind of material disadvantage that is a predicate for a finding of unlawful retaliation.... What was never established is that MacCormack, as a result, suffered an \u2018adverse employment action\u2019 which materially disadvantaged him.\""

It does not articulate or analyze the general duty element of Massachusetts negligence law as a broad requirement that individuals take reasonable precautions to avoid creating foreseeable harm. Any discussion of negligence here is case-specific (negligent supervision/misrepresentation) and not a general statement of Massachusetts negligence duty law.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Summary judgment should not have been granted on the remaining aspects of counts II and III. The judge's ruling was based, in part, on a misapprehension of what evidence could properly be considered. Viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and taking into account all properly considered record evidence, a fact finder would be permitted to find that Wood told Michelle to choose between continuing the old policy at a higher premium or applying for a new policy at a lower rate...."
