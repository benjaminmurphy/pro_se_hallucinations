It does not address heavy items, stacking practices, or safety precautions related to stacking. The court\u2019s reasoning is limited to foreseeability of debris/spillage (like fruit and vegetables) on the floor in a self-service setting, so using this case to support a proposition about improperly stacked heavy items misstates its holding.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cIn particular, as is the case here, fruit and vegetable debris presents an obvious risk of injury to a customer, and a reasonably prudent person would not place these items in an aisle or allow them to remain there. Thus, because the determination of reasonableness is a question of fact, the trier of fact must determine whether the owner could reasonably foresee or anticipate that a foreseeable risk stemming from the owner\u2019s mode of operation could occur and whether the owner exercised reasonable care in maintaining the premise in a safe condition commensurate with these foreseeable risks.\u201d"
