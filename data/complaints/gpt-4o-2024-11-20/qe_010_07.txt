**Emily Thompson**  
**Plaintiff,**  

v.  

**Sarah Bennett**  
**Defendant.**

---

**CIVIL ACTION NO.:** [To Be Assigned by Clerk]  

**COMPLAINT**  

**INTRODUCTION**

1. This is a civil action brought by Plaintiff Emily Thompson (“Plaintiff”) against her landlord, Defendant Sarah Bennett (“Defendant”), for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment arising out of Defendant's failure to maintain Plaintiff's rental unit in a habitable condition free from dangerous and unsanitary mold. Defendant's actions and inactions have caused Plaintiff harm, including physical health problems, property damage, and discomfort, in violation of Massachusetts law.  

**PARTIES**

2. Plaintiff, Emily Thompson, is an adult individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts, 01852 (“the Premises”), which Plaintiff has rented from Defendant since May 1, 2022.  

3. Defendant, Sarah Bennett, is the owner and landlord of the Premises, which is a residential property located in Lowell, Massachusetts.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19, providing jurisdiction over civil actions of this nature in the Massachusetts District Courts.  

5. Venue is proper in Lowell District Court because the Premises is located in Lowell, Massachusetts, and the events giving rise to the claims occurred within this Court's jurisdiction.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

6. On or about May 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant to rent the Premises for $1,200 per month.  

7. The Premises includes a bathroom that lacks windows and relies solely on an exhaust fan for ventilation.  

8. Beginning in or around October 2025, mold began growing in the bathroom, starting in the shower area and spreading to the ceiling over time.  

9. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant about the mold issue and requested that it be addressed.  

10. Defendant inspected the bathroom but refused to appropriately address the cause of the mold, instead blaming Plaintiff’s use of the bathroom, including alleged failure to run the exhaust fan and taking “too hot” or “too long” showers.  

11. Despite Plaintiff's reasonable use of the bathroom and efforts to ventilate the space using the exhaust fan, the mold has persisted, spreading across the bathroom and causing damage to personal property, including a shower curtain and towels which Plaintiff was forced to discard at a cost of $60.  

12. The presence of mold has negatively impacted Plaintiff’s health, causing respiratory symptoms including coughing, congestion, and wheezing. Plaintiff’s physician has advised that her condition is likely related to the mold and has recommended its remediation.  

13. Defendant has failed to take any remedial action to address the ventilation issues or permanently remove the mold, despite her legal obligation to provide a habitable dwelling and a safe and healthy living environment.  

14. As a result of Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiff has suffered damages, including (a) loss of enjoyment and use of her rental unit, (b) personal property damage, (c) medical issues and related inconvenience, and (d) emotional distress.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  

15. Plaintiff incorporates all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  

16. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, every residential lease in Massachusetts includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, which prohibits landlords from interfering with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of their rental premises.  

17. Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment by failing to maintain the Premises in a habitable condition, and Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises have been substantially impaired as a direct result.  

18. The presence of mold in the bathroom, caused or allowed by Defendant’s refusal to adequately address ongoing ventilation issues, constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises.  

19. Massachusetts law imposes a duty on landlords to provide habitable premises, as established in *Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184 (1973). A dwelling rendered unsafe or unhealthy violates this fundamental obligation.  

20. The mold in the Premises has rendered the bathroom unsafe and unsanitary, in direct contravention of Massachusetts habitability standards and applicable housing codes, such as the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. § 410.750.  

21. Defendant's failure to remediate the mold, as well as her refusal to address the underlying ventilation issues, violates her statutory duty under G.L. c. 186, § 14 and constitutes a per se breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  

22. Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment entitles Plaintiff to recover actual damages and statutory damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:  

1. Actual damages in the amount of $150 to reimburse Plaintiff for costs incurred as a result of Defendant’s breach, including property damage and interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.  

2. Statutory damages in an amount equal to three months’ rent, or $3,600, as provided by G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

3. An order requiring Defendant to remediate the mold in the bathroom and address any underlying ventilation issues to prevent further occurrences.  

4. Costs of this action, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, as permitted under G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

5. Any other relief this Court deems just and equitable.  

**DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL**  

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

**Respectfully submitted,**  

Dated: December 1, 2025
