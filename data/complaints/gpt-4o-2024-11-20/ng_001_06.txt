### **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**
7. On August 12, 2023, at approximately 3:00 p.m., Plaintiff Emily Carter was shopping at Defendant’s grocery store located at 150 Washington Street in Somerville, Massachusetts.  
8. While walking down the dairy aisle of the store, Plaintiff slipped on a large puddle of spilled milk, which caused her to fall forcefully onto the floor and injure her hip.  
9. The spilled milk was readily visible and large enough to display cart tracks traveling through it, demonstrating that the condition had existed for an extended period of time.  
10. There were no wet floor signs, warning cones, or other signage indicating the hazardous condition in the aisle.  
11. At the time of the incident, an employee of the Defendant was stocking shelves approximately 15 feet from the spill and, after the Plaintiff fell, admitted he was aware of the spill and had noticed it "a few minutes ago." However, the employee failed to address the hazard or warn customers until after finishing his work on the shelves.  
12. Plaintiff initially believed her injuries to be minor and completed her shopping. That evening, she experienced severe pain in her hip, requiring her to seek medical treatment the following day.  
13. Plaintiff was diagnosed with a hip sprain at urgent care and underwent physical therapy for several weeks.  
14. As a result of the injury, Plaintiff incurred medical expenses totaling approximately $2,500 and lost $1,200 in wages due to missed work at her job as a café employee.  
15. Defendant had a duty under Massachusetts law to use reasonable care to maintain the premises in a safe condition for patrons, to inspect the premises for hazards, and to take remedial action or warn patrons of hazards it knew or should have known existed.  
16. Defendant breached its duty of care by failing to promptly clean up the spilled milk, failing to warn customers of the hazard, and failing to adequately monitor and inspect the premises.  
17. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered physical injuries, financial losses, and emotional distress.

### **CAUSE OF ACTION: NEGLIGENCE**
18. Plaintiff restates and incorporates by reference the allegations in Paragraphs 1 through 17 as though fully set forth herein.  
19. Defendant owed a duty of reasonable care to the Plaintiff and all lawful invitees to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition.  
20. Defendant breached its duty of care by:  
   a. Failing to promptly clean up the spilled milk;  
   b. Failing to post adequate warnings of the hazardous condition; and  
   c. Failing to properly inspect and monitor the premises.  
21. Defendant’s breach of its duty of care was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages.  
22. Under Massachusetts case law, including *Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.*, 448 Mass. 780 (2007), and *Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority*, 363 Mass. 165 (1973), a property owner is liable when it has actual or constructive notice of a dangerous condition and fails to remedy it.  
23. Defendant, through its employee who admitted awareness of the danger prior to the incident, had actual notice of the spilled milk and failed to act reasonably to address it.  
24. Alternatively, Defendant had constructive notice of the hazard due to the length of time the spilled milk was present, as evidenced by cart tracks passing through the puddle, visible to any reasonable employee performing inspections.  
25. Plaintiff’s injuries and damages are a reasonably foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s breach of its duty of care.
