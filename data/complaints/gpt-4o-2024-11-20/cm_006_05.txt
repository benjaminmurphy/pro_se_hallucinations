|                                  v.                                  | **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  
| **JAMES SMITH**, Defendant    |  

**INTRODUCTION**  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, **Sarah Thompson**, in the above-entitled matter, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court for a modification of the current custody order concerning the minor children, Emily Smith (aged 10) and Lucas Smith (aged 8), on the grounds that material and substantial changes in circumstances have occurred, warranting a modification to ensure the children’s safety and best interests.  

This request is supported by factual allegations set forth below and legal authority under Massachusetts General Laws c. 208, § 28, and related family law precedent.  

**PARTIES**  

1. **Plaintiff**, Sarah Thompson, resides at [insert Plaintiff’s address], within the jurisdiction of the Bristol Probate and Family Court.  
2. **Defendant**, James Smith, resides at [insert Defendant’s address], also within the jurisdiction of the Bristol Probate and Family Court.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

3. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, which governs custody and visitation matters.  
4. Venue is proper in this Court under G.L. c. 215, § 6, as the parties reside in Bristol County.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

5. On or about **June 15, 2021**, this Court issued a custody order granting the Plaintiff primary physical custody of the minor children, with Defendant receiving parenting time on alternate weekends and one midweek visit.  
6. At the time of the original order, neither party was in a serious relationship, and the judgment did not contemplate the involvement of third parties during Defendant’s parenting time.  
7. Since the entry of the order, Defendant has begun residing with an individual, **[insert third party’s name, if known]**, who has a **documented criminal history**, including **assault and battery** and the issuance of a restraining order obtained by a prior romantic partner.  
8. Plaintiff has substantial concerns about the safety and well-being of the children while in Defendant’s care as a result of this new living arrangement.  
   a. The children have reported that Defendant’s partner frequently **yells, slams doors**, and exhibits volatile behavior while they are present.  
   b. On or about [insert date], Defendant’s partner **grabbed Lucas by the arm with sufficient force to leave visible marks**, causing Lucas pain and emotional distress.  
   c. During a separate incident, a neighbor called the police in response to a **loud and heated argument** between Defendant and his partner, which occurred while the children were at Defendant’s home.  

9. The above-described incidents establish a material change in circumstances since the prior custody order, as such behavior and environment pose an ongoing risk to the children’s emotional and physical safety.  
10. Plaintiff has consistently acted in good faith to shield the children from harmful circumstances and seeks this modification to ensure their best interests, as defined under G.L. c. 208, § 31.  

**LEGAL GROUNDS FOR RELIEF**  

11. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, this Court has the authority to modify custody or parenting time provisions upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances that affects the best interests of the children.  
12. Massachusetts law recognizes the court’s duty to prioritize the children’s safety and well-being. **Hunter v. Rose**, 463 Mass. 488, 492 (2012).  
13. Parenting time or custody arrangements that expose children to harmful or unsafe conditions must be re-evaluated. **Pizzino v. Miller**, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865, 869 (2006).  
14. The best interests of the children are of paramount importance in custody consideration, as articulated in **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704, 710 (1985).  
15. Courts may consider the presence of third parties in the home and the impact of their behavior when assessing modifications. **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177, 184 (2006).  
16. An unsafe or volatile environment endangers emotional and physical well-being, warranting restrictions on parenting time. **Carey v. Carey**, 44 Mass. App. Ct. 980, 980-81 (1998).  
17. Courts have held that children’s welfare should not be neglected for the sake of parental access without adequate safeguards in place. **Hale v. Hale**, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 812, 819 (1981).  
18. The nature and impact of the children’s complaints, such as feeling fearful or unsafe, is a significant factor requiring consideration. **Hickman v. Hickman**, 32 Mass. App. Ct. 594, 596 (1992).  
19. Where police involvement at a parent’s residence occurs, this is relevant to determine the safety of parenting conditions. **Smith v. McDonald**, 458 Mass. 540, 546 (2010).  
20. This Court has the discretion to impose supervised visitation or other protective measures where necessary. **Alberto v. Commonwealth**, 472 Mass. 75, 87 (2015).  

**REQUEST FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Modify the current custody order to protect the children’s emotional and physical safety, either by:  
   a. Prohibiting the participation of Defendant’s current partner in the children’s parenting time; or  
   b. Ordering all parenting time between Defendant and the children to be **supervised by an appropriate third party**.  
2. Grant any and all other relief deemed necessary and just to serve the best interests of the children.  

Respectfully submitted,  
**Sarah Thompson**, Plaintiff  

Date: December 1, 2025
