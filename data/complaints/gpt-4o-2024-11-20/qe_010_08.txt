### FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

5. On or about June 1, 2022, Plaintiff Jessica Collins entered into a rental agreement with Defendant Linda Matthews for the residential premises located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts (the "Premises"). Plaintiff agreed to pay monthly rent of $1,200 under the terms of the lease agreement.  
6. The bathroom in the Premises does not contain a window but is equipped with an exhaust fan, which Plaintiff runs regularly during showers.  
7. In or around July 2025, mold began to grow in the bathroom, starting in the corner of the shower and spreading to the ceiling.  
8. Plaintiff promptly reported the mold issue to Defendant, who inspected the bathroom and blamed the Plaintiff, alleging the issue was caused by Plaintiff's failure to run the exhaust fan during showers and by taking "long, hot showers."  
9. Plaintiff has run the exhaust fan regularly and uses the bathroom in a reasonable and ordinary manner. Defendant's assertions are unfounded and fail to account for structural or ventilation deficiencies in the bathroom.  
10. Despite Plaintiff's notification, Defendant failed to remediate the mold growth or address ventilation deficiencies. Defendant stated she would clean the existing mold but would not improve the ventilation system, blaming the issue on the Plaintiff.  
11. Since the mold appeared, Plaintiff has experienced significant respiratory issues, including coughing, congestion, and wheezing, which were not present prior to living in the Premises. Plaintiff's doctor has advised that these symptoms are likely due to exposure to mold in the rental unit.  
12. Plaintiff incurred approximately $60 in costs for replacing personal property damaged by the mold, including a shower curtain and towels.  
13. Defendant's failure to remediate the mold issue and address inadequate ventilation constitutes a violation of Plaintiff's right to quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

### CAUSE OF ACTION  

**COUNT I – BREACH OF COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**  
(Against Defendant Linda Matthews)  

14. Plaintiff repeats and realleges all allegations set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 13 as if fully set forth herein.  
15. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Massachusetts law provides tenants a right to the quiet enjoyment of the premises they rent, which is violated when landlords engage in acts or omissions that interfere with the use and enjoyment of the rental property.  
16. Defendant's failure to properly remediate the mold and address inadequate ventilation has materially and unreasonably interfered with Plaintiff's use and enjoyment of the Premises.  
17. The presence of mold and Defendant’s refusal to make necessary repairs creates unsafe living conditions and prevents Plaintiff from reasonably using the bathroom without harmful consequences to her health.  
18. Defendant's actions and failure to act constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14.  
19. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's breach, Plaintiff has suffered physical harm, damage to personal property, and loss of the enjoyment and use of her home.
