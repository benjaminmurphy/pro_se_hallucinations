**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**BERKSHIRE DIVISION, SUPERIOR COURT DEPARTMENT**  
**CIVIL ACTION NO. ___________**

**Emily Johnson,**  
   Plaintiff,  

v.  

**John Smith,**  
   Defendant.  

**COMPLAINT**  

**PARTIES**  

1. The Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, is an individual residing at 456 Main Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts.  
2. The Defendant, John Smith, is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts, where the incident giving rise to this action occurred.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this case under G.L. c. 212, § 4, as it is a civil action in which the damages exceed $25,000.  
4. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1, as the acts and omissions giving rise to the events in question occurred in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, within the jurisdiction of the Berkshire Division of the Superior Court.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

5. On or about August 15, 2023, Plaintiff Emily Johnson was walking on the public sidewalk adjacent to Defendant John Smith’s property located at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts.  
6. On the property in question, a large maple tree had a significant branch hanging over the sidewalk that was noticeably cracked and drooping for an extended period prior to the date of the incident.  
7. Multiple neighbors, as well as Plaintiff herself, observed the hazardous condition of the branch and expressed concerns about its integrity to the Defendant.  
8. Despite these warnings and the visibly unsafe condition of the tree, Defendant negligently failed to act to remedy the danger. Defendant neither hired a professional arborist to assess the condition nor removed the branch, even after being made aware of the risk to passersby.  
9. On August 15, 2023, during a normal summer thunderstorm, the cracked and compromised branch broke from the tree and fell onto Plaintiff as she was walking on the sidewalk.  
10. The branch struck Plaintiff on her shoulder and back, causing her to fall to the ground and sustain physical injuries including a shoulder strain and significant bruising.  
11. As a result of the incident, Plaintiff incurred medical expenses totaling $1,200 and lost approximately $400 in wages due to her inability to work at her retail job for one week.  
12. Plaintiff has also experienced physical pain, emotional distress, and disruption to her day-to-day life as a result of Defendant’s failure to address the unsafe condition of the tree.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION: NEGLIGENCE**  

13. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.  
14. Under Massachusetts law, a property owner owes a duty of reasonable care to persons lawfully on or near their property to prevent harm caused by unsafe conditions known to the owner. **Papadopoulos v. Target Corp., 457 Mass. 368, 930 N.E.2d 142 (2010)**; **Halley v. Hugh Nawn, Inc., 356 Mass. 28, 247 N.E.2d 333 (1969)**.  
15. Defendant John Smith breached this duty of care by failing to address the known unsafe condition of the cracked and drooping branch hanging over the sidewalk on his property.  
16. A reasonably prudent person in Defendant’s position would have acted to remove, trim, or inspect the tree branch after being notified of its condition. **Gleason v. Hillcrest Builders, Inc., 37 Mass. App. Ct. 642, 642 N.E.2d 279 (1994)**; **Souza v. Southworth, 326 Mass. 121, 93 N.E.2d 737 (1950)**.  
17. Defendant’s failure to act when he knew or reasonably should have known of the hazardous condition constituted negligence. **Gill v. Usher, 327 Mass. 641, 100 N.E.2d 537 (1951)**; **Banaghan v. Dewey, 340 Mass. 73, 162 N.E.2d 807 (1959)**.  
18. Defendant’s negligence was the proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries. **Donahue v. Irving, 335 Mass. 394, 140 N.E.2d 219 (1957)**; **MacDonald v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., 394 Mass. 131, 475 N.E.2d 65 (1985)**.  
19. Plaintiff’s injuries, including her shoulder strain, bruising, medical expenses, lost wages, and associated pain and suffering, were a direct and foreseeable result of Defendant’s breach of duty.  

**DAMAGES**  

20. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has sustained damages, including but not limited to:  
   a) $1,200 in past medical expenses;  
   b) $400 in lost wages;  
   c) Physical pain, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:  

1. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering;  
2. Prejudgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;  
3. Reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of this action to the extent permitted by law;  
4. Such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.  

**JURY DEMAND**  

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,  

_Date: December 1, 2025_
