v.

Defendant.  

C.A. No. ___________  

### COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  

**Introduction**  

This is a civil action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law. Plaintiff Jessica Thompson seeks damages against Defendant Mark Reynolds, her landlord, for failing to provide adequate heat during the winter months while she occupied an apartment at 123 Ashmont Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts, in violation of Massachusetts General Laws and established caselaw.  

**Parties and Jurisdiction**  

1. Plaintiff Jessica Thompson ("Plaintiff") is a resident of Dorchester, Massachusetts, and the tenant of the premises located at 123 Ashmont Street, Dorchester, MA 02124.  

2. Defendant Mark Reynolds ("Defendant") is, upon information and belief, a resident of Massachusetts and the owner and lessor of the apartment building located at 123 Ashmont Street, Dorchester, MA 02124.  

3. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 2. Venue is proper because the rental property is located in Dorchester, Massachusetts, and Plaintiff resides in the same jurisdiction.  

**Factual Allegations**  

4. On or about June 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a written tenancy agreement with Defendant for the rental of a two-bedroom apartment at 123 Ashmont Street, Dorchester, MA 02124.  

5. Under the tenancy agreement, Plaintiff has paid monthly rent in the amount of $1,800 and has performed all her obligations as a tenant.  

6. Throughout the winter of 2024–2025, the heating system in Plaintiff's apartment malfunctioned regularly. Specifically, the heat would drop to approximately 60 degrees Fahrenheit for several hours during the evenings, leaving the apartment excessively cold despite the cold weather outside.  

7. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the issues with the heating system, and Defendant temporarily sent repair technicians on two occasions. However, neither repair fully resolved the problem. After the second repair attempt, the boiler was described as "old but functional," and the problem persisted.  

8. As a result of the recurring heating issues, Plaintiff was forced to purchase two space heaters to maintain livable temperatures in her apartment. This caused her electric bills to rise by approximately $150 per month throughout the winter.  

9. In January 2025, Plaintiff contracted bronchitis, which her doctor opined was likely exacerbated by the cold conditions in her apartment. Plaintiff was required to miss three days of work and incur out-of-pocket expenses for medication.  

10. Plaintiff repeatedly informed Defendant of the persistent heating issues, but Defendant stated that the heat was functioning because it never completely went out and the building remained above freezing.  

11. Defendant’s failure to provide adequate heat violates the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law, as Plaintiff was deprived of the full use and enjoyment of her apartment in a manner that was unreasonable and interfered with her right to a habitable dwelling.  

12. Defendant's failure to resolve the heating issue caused Plaintiff financial harm, physical suffering, and emotional distress.  

**Cause of Action – Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  

13. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  

14. Under Massachusetts law, every residential lease implicitly includes a covenant of quiet enjoyment, codified at G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

15. Defendant’s failure to provide adequate heating during the winter months constituted a substantial interference with the Plaintiff's use and enjoyment of her apartment, in breach of this covenant.  

16. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, any landlord who interferes with a tenant's quiet enjoyment is liable for actual and consequential damages or, at the tenant’s election, three months’ rent, whichever is greater.  

17. Defendant’s actions constitute unreasonable and unlawful interference with Plaintiff’s tenancy and have directly caused Plaintiff harm.  

18. Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment is further supported by caselaw, including but not limited to *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982), which holds that tenants are entitled to pursue remedies when landlords negligently or unreasonably interfere with a tenant's use and enjoyment of their property.  

**Prayer for Relief**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:  

a. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff on her claim of breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;  

b. Award Plaintiff actual damages of no less than $600, plus an additional award of three months’ rent pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 (totaling $5,400);  

c. Award Plaintiff damages for her pain and suffering, emotional distress, and any other related consequential damages directly caused by Defendant's breach, in an amount to be determined at trial;  

d. Award Plaintiff attorneys’ fees and costs; and  

e. Award such other and further relief as this Court deems just and equitable.  

**Jury Demand**  

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,  

Dated: December 1, 2025
