      "support_reasoning": "The proposition asserts that Adoption of Nancy is authority for immediate intervention under a court\u2019s broad equitable power to protect minors from a substantial risk of harm. Adoption of Nancy instead concerns statutory termination of parental rights under G.L. c. 210 and c. 119, applying the \u2018best interests\u2019 and parental unfitness framework after lengthy care-and-protection proceedings. The opinion does not discuss or invoke any separate, broad equitable authority for emergency or immediate intervention by an appellate court; it addresses when termination may be ordered and how children\u2019s wishes factor into that decision.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cIn determining whether to dispense with parental consent to adoption, a judge must \u2018evaluate whether the [parent is] able to assume the duties and responsibilities required of a parent and whether dispensing with the need for parental consent will be in the best interests of the children.\u2019 \u2026 After ascertaining unfitness, the judge must determine whether the parent\u2019s unfitness is such that it would be in the child\u2019s best interests to end all legal relations between parent and child.\u201d"
