The court surveys its prior quiet-enjoyment cases (Simon, Cruz, Darmetko, Dorgan, Doe) and emphasizes that, consistently, liability arises where the landlord unreasonably fails to act regarding known problems whose natural and probable consequence is interference with the tenant\u2019s quiet enjoyment. This aligns with the proposition that Massachusetts courts uphold tenants\u2019 rights where there is substantial landlord-caused interference.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cIn Cruz Mgt. Co. v. Thomas, supra, we rejected a claim that a violation of G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, could be imposed only if it were proved that a landlord was reckless in disregarding his tenant\u2019s rights, and we concluded that negligent conduct, conduct involving \u2018some degree of fault,\u2019 by a landlord could support the imposition of liability under \u00a7 14. \u2026 Indeed, in each case since the 1973 statutory revision in which we have recognized a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, there was evidence that the landlord failed to act reasonably in the circumstances concerning a problem known to the landlord, and the natural and probable consequences of such failure caused the interference with the tenant\u2019s quiet enjoyment of the premises.\u201d"

The court reverses summary judgment on the quiet enjoyment claim and explains that if the landlord\u2019s failure to act to remove drug dealers in common areas results in tenants\u2019 substantial loss of use, that may be a breach. This aligns with the proposition that Massachusetts courts uphold tenants\u2019 rights under the covenant when there is substantial landlord-caused interference.",

The landlords here were held liable for constructive eviction due to severe noise from a lounge they leased to others, despite the finding that they did not intend to create the conditions, aligning closely with the stated proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThere are occasions, however, where a landlord has not intended to violate a tenant\u2019s rights, but there was nevertheless a breach of the landlord\u2019s covenant of quiet enjoyment which flowed as the natural and probable consequence of what the landlord did, what he failed to do, or what he permitted to be done\u2026. Although some of our opinions have spoken of particular action or inaction by a landlord as showing a presumed intention to evict, the landlord\u2019s conduct, and not his intentions, is controlling.\u201d"
