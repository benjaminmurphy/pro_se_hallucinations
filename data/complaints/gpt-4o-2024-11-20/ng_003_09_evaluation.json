It does not involve a defendant stacking heavy boxes of merchandise, store shelving practices, or premises liability based on how merchandise is stored for invitees. The duty and breach analysis here is about product/design negligence for utility poles in a public streetscape, not about negligent stacking of goods in a store, so it does not support the claimed proposition.",

It does not address premises liability, inspection of shelving or merchandise, foreseeability of collapse from customer contact, or any duty to remedy a dangerous condition.

      "relevant_excerpt": "1. A motion to dismiss under Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6)... lies against a complaint which shows on its face that the statute of limitations has run prior to the date the action was commenced... 2. Counts I and VII clearly sounded in tort and were thus barred by the two-year statute of limitations found in G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2A... 3. Accepting the plaintiffs\u2019 characterization of counts II, III and IV as alleging in \"essence ... that the defendants, as controlling parties, owed a fiduciary duty...\" we agree... that the alleged breaches of that duty... sounded in tort rather than in contract."

Scott v. Garfield does involve personal injury caused by a defective porch railing and upholds a damages award, but it does not articulate or analyze any specific rule about pleading or proving that injuries were the \u2018direct and proximate result\u2019 of negligence. The opinion instead focuses on implied warranty of habitability, status of lawful visitors, spoliation, and evidentiary issues, so it does not serve as authority for the particular causation-pleading proposition quoted.",
