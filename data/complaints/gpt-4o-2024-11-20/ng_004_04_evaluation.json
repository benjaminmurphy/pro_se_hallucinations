The claimed proposition, however, refers to a duty to maintain a sidewalk \u2018adjoining 123 Maple Street\u2019 and to comply with \u2018applicable laws and ordinances\u2019 governing sidewalk snow removal\u2014issues that sound in abutting\u2011landowner/sidewalk/public way law and in statutory or ordinance-based duties, which this opinion expressly distinguishes and does not decide. Thus, the case supports a general reasonable-care duty as to snow and ice on the owner\u2019s property, but not specifically a duty to maintain an adjoining sidewalk or to comply with municipal snow-removal ordinances.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cWe now will apply to hazards arising from snow and ice the same obligation that a property owner owes to lawful visitors as to all other hazards: a duty to \u2018act as a reasonable person under all of the circumstances\u2026.\u2019 \u2026 Under this traditional premises liability standard, a fact finder will determine what snow and ice removal efforts are reasonable\u2026. The snow removal reasonably expected of a property owner will depend on the amount of foot traffic\u2026 the magnitude of the risk\u2026 and the burden and expense of snow and ice removal.\u201d"
