In discussing the common-law covenant of quiet enjoyment and G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, the opinion affirms that substantial interferences with the tenant\u2019s use and enjoyment (here, repeated flooding and unsanitary conditions) constitute a violation of quiet enjoyment, thus supporting the proposition.",

It relies on both the statute and common-law quiet enjoyment precedent (e.g., Blackett v. Olanoff) to impose liability based on negligent omissions that substantially impaired the value of the premises. Thus the case supports the proposition that similar landlord actions violate c. 186, \u00a7 14 and Massachusetts common law.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cCruz Management had notice of numerous sanitary, building and fire code violations in the apartment leased by Thomas. It was wholly foreseeable (in fact, it was inevitable) that the failure adequately to correct these violations, which included inadequate heat and hot water and a serious infestation of vermin, would impair substantially the value of the leased premises as a dwelling place for Thomas and her family. On the facts found by the judge a violation of \u00a7 14 has been shown.\u201d"

The SJC reverses summary judgment on the \u00a7 14 claim and states that if the housing authority failed to take adequate action to remove wrongdoers whose presence seriously interferes with tenants\u2019 use, it may be liable and tenants are entitled to judgment, injunctive relief, costs, and fees. Thus the opinion supports the proposition that such landlord inaction can violate \u00a7 14 and related common-law quiet enjoyment principles.",

There must be a trial to determine what, if any, measures the defendant has taken to remove nontenants engaged in unlawful activity and to determine the seriousness or substantiality of the interference with the tenancies. If the defendant has taken no action or inadequate action\u2026 then the plaintiffs will be entitled to judgment, appropriate injunctive relief, costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. See G.

The court explicitly rejects a strict intent requirement and a nonfeasance/malfeasance distinction, thereby establishing landlord liability for such disruptions when within the landlord\u2019s control.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cBecause the disturbing condition was the natural and probable consequence of the landlords\u2019 permitting the lounge to operate where it did and because the landlords could control the actions at the lounge, they should not be entitled to collect rent for residential premises which were not reasonably habitable. Tenants such as these should not be left only with a claim against the proprietors of the noisome lounge\u2026 we decline to perpetuate that distinction where the landlord creates a situation and has the right to control the objectionable conditions.\u201d"

This is a substantive interpretation of the scope and prerequisites of liability under \u00a7 14, so the case appropriately supports a proposition about analysis of liability under that statute.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cToday we make clear what was implicit in those rulings: to support the imposition of liability under the quiet enjoyment statute, there must be a showing of at least negligent conduct by a landlord and violation of the lead paint statute alone is not sufficient to prove such negligence. Stated differently, to obtain relief under \u00a7 14 for a claim of lead paint poisoning it must be demonstrated that the landlord had notice of or reason to know of the presence of lead and failed to take appropriate corrective measures.\u201d"

The Court explicitly declines to recognize any constitutional right of tenants to occupy or enjoy leased property beyond the terms of their lease or without payment of rent, and emphasizes that landlord-tenant rights are primarily matters of state substantive law, not federally guaranteed tenant enjoyment rights. Thus it does not establish or affirm a general legal principle of tenant rights to property enjoyment; if anything, it rejects such a constitutional claim.",

Absent constitutional mandate, the assurance of adequate housing and the definition of landlord-tenant relationships are legislative, not judicial, functions.\u201d"
