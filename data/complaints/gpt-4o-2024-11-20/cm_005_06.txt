Plaintiff,  

v.  

**Mark Johnson,**  
Defendant.  
___  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**  

**NOW COMES THE PLAINTIFF, Laura Johnson,** and respectfully petitions the Court to modify the custody order entered on June 15, 2021, by the Middlesex Probate and Family Court. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, and the equitable powers of this Court, the Plaintiff states that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the original custody order that warrants modification to better serve the best interests of the children. In support of this Complaint, the Plaintiff states as follows:  

### 1. Parties.  

1.1. Plaintiff, Laura Johnson, resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, with the subject minor children, Emma Johnson (age 10) and Jake Johnson (age 8).  

1.2. Defendant, Mark Johnson, resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  

1.3. Pursuant to the Court’s Order entered on June 15, 2021, the parties share legal custody of the children. The children primarily reside with the Plaintiff, and the Defendant exercises parenting time with the children as set forth in the aforementioned court order.  

### 2. Jurisdiction.  

2.1. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, and the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, G.L. c. 209B, as this matter pertains to the custody and care of children who presently reside in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  

### 3. Factual Allegations.  

3.1. On June 15, 2021, the Court entered a custody order awarding the parties shared legal custody of the children, with the Plaintiff as the primary custodial parent and the Defendant enjoying regular visitation.  

3.2. The original custody order balanced the rights and responsibilities of both parents, including provisions requiring the parties to support the children’s relationships with each parent and to refrain from disparaging the other parent in the presence of the children.  

3.3. Over the past year, the Defendant has engaged in a repeated pattern of poor communication and unilateral decision-making regarding the children’s schedules, in direct violation of the legal custody requirements. Specifically:  

- The Defendant has unilaterally scheduled extracurricular activities for the children during the Plaintiff’s parenting time, without consultation or agreement.  
- The Defendant has blamed the Plaintiff for conflicts arising from these unilateral changes, telling the children it is the Plaintiff’s fault if they are unable to attend these activities while in the Plaintiff’s care.  

3.4. Additionally, the Defendant has made persistent disparaging remarks about the Plaintiff in the children’s presence, including statements to the effect that the Plaintiff is “selfish” and “doesn’t really love them.”  

3.5. As a direct result of the Defendant’s conduct, the children have begun to experience emotional distress. The older child, Emma, has exhibited anxiety and has reported stomach aches on transition days between households.  

3.6. This pattern of conduct constitutes a material change in circumstances because:  
- It undermines the cooperative framework necessary for shared legal custody, as recognized in **Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006)**.  
- It has begun to negatively impact the children, contrary to their best interests as defined in **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985)**.  

3.7. The Defendant’s actions represent a failure to uphold duties of joint custody and parental cooperation under Massachusetts law, as described in **Pizzino v. Miller, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006)**.  

3.8. The children’s best interests, as the paramount standard in custody determinations, see **Bindra v. Bindra, 91 Mass. App. Ct. 725 (2017)**, require that their emotional well-being and consistent routine be prioritized.  

### 4. Legal Basis for Modification.  

4.1. The substantial changes in circumstances—including the Defendant’s lack of communication, unilateral decision-making, and disparagement of the Plaintiff—warrant modification under **G.L. c. 208, § 28**.  

4.2. Massachusetts courts have consistently held that custodial modifications are appropriate where changes in circumstances affect the children’s welfare. See **Hunter v. Rose, 463 Mass. 488 (2012)**; **Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981)**.  

4.3. The Defendant’s behavior has disrupted the co-parenting dynamic necessary for shared legal custody, creating an environment that is not conducive to the children’s best interests as required by **G.L. c. 208, § 31**.  

### 5. Relief Requested.  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

5.1. Modify the custody order to award the Plaintiff sole legal custody of the minor children;  

5.2. Institute a parenting schedule that maintains reasonable visitation with the Defendant while providing clear guidelines for decision-making authority regarding the children’s schedules and activities;  

5.3. Order the Defendant to refrain from making disparaging statements about the Plaintiff in the presence of the children;  

5.4. Provide such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

Respectfully submitted,
