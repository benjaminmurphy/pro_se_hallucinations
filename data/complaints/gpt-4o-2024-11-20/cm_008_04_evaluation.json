Rubin, 370 Mass. 857 [1976]; Hale v. Hale, supra at 815), and thus the central question in this case is how these \u2018best interests\u2019 are to be determined.\u201d"

It does not discuss academic performance, school attendance, or what constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances warranting modification of custody under Massachusetts standards.

While the court notes that the twins attend school and references guidance counselors, it does not articulate any principle that stable, consistent school attendance is a critical component of a child\u2019s best interests.

The claimed proposition concerns standards for modification, which this case does not address at all.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "We conclude, in rejection of the facial due process challenge made by the mother, that the statute satisfies strict scrutiny because our construction narrowly tailors it to further the compelling State interest in protecting the welfare of a child who has experienced a disruption in the family unit from harm."

The case concerns an initial (post-paternity) award of sole legal and physical custody to the father, not a modification proceeding, and therefore does not directly support the proposition about courts\u2019 broad discretion to fashion modifications to existing arrangements. It is solid authority on broad discretion in custody decisions generally, but not on modification power in particular.",
