**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

6. On January 15, 2022, Plaintiff began renting a two-bedroom apartment located at 456 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts from Defendant pursuant to a written residential lease agreement.  

7. Plaintiff currently pays $1,200 per month in rent, which she has paid in full and on time during the entire term of her tenancy.  

8. Beginning approximately six weeks prior to the filing date of this Complaint, the electrical outlets and overhead light in one of the bedrooms of the apartment ceased functioning due to faulty wiring specific to that room.  

9. The bedroom was being used by Plaintiff as a home office, a critical component of her apartment, as she regularly works remotely.  

10. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the electrical issue, and Defendant subsequently sent an electrician to inspect the problem.  

11. The electrician advised that the issue would require significant repair due to the building’s old wiring.  

12. Defendant has failed to resolve the issue, claiming that obtaining repair quotes and scheduling work is “complicated,” and has allowed the condition to persist for over six weeks.  

13. As a result of the loss of electrical service, Plaintiff has been unable to use the bedroom as a home office or for any purpose, causing substantial interference with the use and enjoyment of her apartment.  

14. Plaintiff has been forced to work from coffee shops and pay for a coworking space membership at an additional cost of approximately $15 per day for coffee and food, as well as $150 per month for the coworking space.  

15. Additionally, Plaintiff’s furniture, equipment, and other belongings that were in the bedroom have been relocated to the living room, rendering the entire apartment unreasonably cramped, uncomfortable, and difficult to use.  

16. Plaintiff has notified Defendant of these consequences on numerous occasions, but Defendant has failed to take meaningful steps to restore the premises to a habitable and livable condition.  

17. Defendant’s inaction has resulted in a material failure to maintain the premises and constitutes a violation of Plaintiff’s statutory and contractual right to quiet enjoyment.

**CAUSE OF ACTION: BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**  

18. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs.  

19. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, every residential lease in Massachusetts includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, which guarantees tenants the right to undisturbed use and enjoyment of the leased premises.  

20. Defendant’s failure to repair the electrical issues in the bedroom has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy her apartment, in violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  

21. The deprivation of use of one of the apartment's bedrooms has rendered the entire apartment less habitable and less valuable to Plaintiff, causing significant inconvenience and additional expenses.  

22. Massachusetts law holds that a complete lack of repair or failure to rectify conditions materially interfering with a tenant’s use of the premises constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847 (1997); **Dartmouth v. Silva**, 32 Mass. App. Ct. 207 (1992).  

23. Defendant’s failure to make timely repairs has effectively evicted Plaintiff from part of her apartment, a violation of **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, which holds landlords strictly liable for breaches of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See **Simon v. Solomon**, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).  

24. Defendant’s conduct constitutes willful neglect, subjecting Defendant to treble damages pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14**.

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Mark Thompson, and award the following relief:  

1. Damages, including but not limited to:  
   a. $720 for rent abatement and out-of-pocket expenses incurred due to Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, trebled pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14** to $2,160; and  
   b. Such other actual and compensatory damages to which Plaintiff may be entitled.  

2. An Order requiring Defendant to make all necessary repairs to the apartment to restore its habitability, in accordance with Massachusetts law and applicable building codes.  

3. Plaintiff’s reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, as provided for under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**.  

4. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.
