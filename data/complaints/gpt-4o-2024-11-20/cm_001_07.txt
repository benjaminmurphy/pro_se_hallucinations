**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Laura Matthews, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody and parenting time order entered by this Court on May 15, 2021. As grounds for this Complaint, the Plaintiff states the following:

---

### I. PARTIES
1. Plaintiff **Laura Matthews** resides at [Insert Address], within the jurisdiction of Bristol Probate and Family Court. She is the mother of the minor children, Emily Parker, born [Insert Date of Birth] (age 8) and Jacob Parker, born [Insert Date of Birth] (age 6). 
2. Defendant **Daniel Parker** resides at [Insert Address], also within the jurisdiction of this Court. He is the father of the minor children, Emily and Jacob.

---

### II. JURISDICTION
3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28** and related provisions, as this is the proper venue for matters involving the custody and parenting time of minor children residing in Massachusetts.

---

### III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
4. On **May 15, 2021**, this Court issued a custody order awarding the Plaintiff primary physical custody of the parties' two minor children. The Defendant was granted parenting time consisting of **every other weekend** and **one overnight visit during the week**.  
5. At that time, both Plaintiff and Defendant were employed in standard daytime positions. The custody arrangement therefore accommodated the children’s needs and both parents’ work schedules.
6. Subsequent to the entry of the prior order, there has been a significant and material change in circumstances concerning the Defendant’s work schedule and ability to exercise parenting time as ordered by the Court.  
   a. In or around **[Insert Date of Job Change, if applicable]**, Defendant began working irregular night shifts, specifically from **7:00 PM to 7:00 AM** several nights per week, including evenings overlapping with his designated parenting time.  
   b. As a result of his nightshift employment, the Defendant is unable to consistently exercise overnight parenting time for his children and frequently delivers the children to the Plaintiff’s residence or leaves them under the supervision of his roommate, who is not known to the Plaintiff.  
   c. The Plaintiff has frequently received **short notice or no advance notice** when the Defendant decides he is unable to exercise his scheduled overnight parenting time. On various occasions, the Defendant’s night schedule has left the children without appropriate supervision or emotional support during his parenting time.
7. The material changes described above have caused significant **disruption** to the established custody schedule and place undue strain on the children’s need for stability, predictable routines, and appropriate care.  
8. The children, Emily (8) and Jacob (6), have expressed discomfort with the current arrangement. The Plaintiff has observed that the children often fall asleep on the Defendant’s couch or report feeling exhausted after their overnight visits at his home, which compromises their physical and emotional well-being.  
9. The Plaintiff’s request seeks to modify the custody order to reflect the children’s best interests consistent with Massachusetts law, which prioritizes **stability**, **consistent caregiving**, and **the overall welfare of the minor children** (**G.L. c. 208, § 31**; **Custody of Zia, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 237, 1990**).

---

### IV. REQUEST FOR MODIFICATION
10. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, a modification of a custody or parenting time order requires a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances warranting modification and that any proposed changes are in the **best interests of the minor children** (**Charara v. Yatim, 78 Mass. App. Ct. 325, 2010**).  
11. Plaintiff asserts that the Defendant’s need for a nightshift work schedule as well as his frequent inability to exercise his parenting time as ordered constitutes a **material change in circumstances** requiring modification.  
12. It is in the **best interests** of the children that parenting time be modified to ensure they are cared for by an available and attentive parent during all custodial times, and that their need for stability, consistent sleep, caregiving, and emotional support are safeguarded (**Hunter v. Rose, 463 Mass. 488, 2012**).  

---

### V. REQUESTED RELIEF
WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court modify the current custody order as follows:  
a. That the Defendant’s overnight parenting time only occur on days when he is not scheduled to work his nightshift employment (7:00 PM to 7:00 AM).  
b. That all overnight exchanges require **at least 48 hours’ advance notice** to the Plaintiff.  
c. That the children’s custodial arrangements prioritize their need for stability and care, and any other relief this Court deems just and proper.
