**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**WORCESTER DISTRICT COURT**  

**Emily Martinez,**  
Plaintiff,  
v.  
**Sarah Thompson,**  
Defendant.  

**CIVIL ACTION NO.:** _____________  

**COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND**  

**PARTIES**  
1. Plaintiff, Emily Martinez ("Plaintiff"), is an individual residing in Worcester, Massachusetts.  
2. Defendant, Sarah Thompson ("Defendant"), is an individual residing in Massachusetts and is the owner and operator of the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01603 ("the Property").  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Massachusetts law as this action arises out of a personal injury caused by the negligent acts or omissions of the Defendant.  
4. Venue is proper in this Court as the events giving rise to the Plaintiff's claims occurred at the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts, within this Court’s jurisdiction.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
5. On or about February 15, 2023, Plaintiff was lawfully on the sidewalk abutting the Property for purposes of delivering groceries to one of the tenants who lived at the Property.  
6. Defendant is responsible for maintaining the sidewalk abutting the Property in a safe and reasonably hazard-free condition pursuant to Massachusetts law, including but not limited to G.L. c. 84, §§ 15-18 and the duty of care established by common law precedents.  
7. A snowstorm occurred immediately prior to February 15, 2023, leaving snow on the sidewalk abutting the Property.  
8. Defendant shoveled a narrow path through the snow down the center of the sidewalk but failed to apply sufficient salt, sand, or other treatments to prevent the formation of ice as a result of melting and refreezing.  
9. Over the course of February 13, 2023, to February 15, 2023, the shoveled path turned into a sheet of ice as a result of predictable melting of the snow during the daytime hours and refreezing in the evening.  
10. Defendant was repeatedly informed of the dangerous condition by her tenants, who provided photographic evidence of the ice and warned Defendant of the risk it posed to pedestrians.  
11. Despite these warnings, Defendant negligently failed to take reasonable action to mitigate the hazard. When advised of the ice, Defendant responded that "the sun will take care of it."  
12. On February 15, 2023, while walking to deliver groceries to a tenant at the Property, Plaintiff slipped on the ice created by Defendant’s negligent failure to maintain the sidewalk and suffered a severe lower back injury.  
13. As a result of the fall, Plaintiff required medical treatment and sustained approximately $3,500 in medical expenses.  
14. Plaintiff was unable to work for one week due to her injuries, resulting in lost wages of approximately $800.  
15. Defendant’s conduct in failing to take reasonable steps to address the danger posed by the ice on the sidewalk directly and proximately caused Plaintiff’s injuries and damages.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION: NEGLIGENCE**  
16. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 15 above as though fully set forth herein.  
17. Defendant owed a duty of reasonable care to all individuals lawfully present on the sidewalk abutting the Property to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition pursuant to statute and common law. See *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368 (2010).  
18. Defendant breached her duty of care by failing to clear the ice in a manner reasonably calculated to protect lawful users of the sidewalk from the risk of injury, including:  
    a. Failing to adequately treat the ice with salt, sand, or other de-icing measures; and  
    b. Ignoring warnings from tenants regarding the hazardous condition.  
19. Massachusetts law recognizes that landlords, property owners, and individuals with control over premises abutting sidewalks are obligated to address foreseeable dangers posed to lawful pedestrians. See *Schirripa v. Western Realty, Inc.*, 321 Mass. 735 (1947); *Souza v. Southworth*, 564 F.2d 609 (1st Cir. 1977).  
20. Defendant had actual notice of the icy condition based on tenant warnings and photographs and had an opportunity to remedy the hazard but failed to act. See *Barry v. Beverly Enters.-Mass., Inc.*, 418 Mass. 590, 593 (1994).  
21. Defendant knew or should have known that melted and refrozen snow would create ice and pose a danger to lawful pedestrians. See *Delano v. Garrettson-Ellis Lumber Co.*, 361 Mass. 500 (1972).  
22. Defendant's failure to take reasonable measures was grossly negligent under the circumstances, as her reliance on natural sunlight to remedy the condition was reckless and demonstrated a disregard for pedestrian safety.  
23. Defendant’s breach of her duty of care directly caused Plaintiff to slip and fall, resulting in physical injury and substantial economic losses. See *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 708-09 (1973).  
24. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff incurred medical expenses, suffered lost wages, endured physical and emotional pain, and sustained other damages.  

**DAMAGES**  
25. Plaintiff has suffered damages, including but not limited to:  
    a. Medical expenses in the amount of approximately $3,500;  
    b. Lost wages in the amount of approximately $800;  
    c. Pain and suffering; and  
    d. Other damages to be proven at trial.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully prays that this Honorable Court:  
1. Enter judgment against Defendant for all damages to which Plaintiff is entitled, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering;  
2. Award Plaintiff pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;  
3. Award Plaintiff reasonable attorney’s fees and court costs, as allowed by law; and  
4. Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.  

**DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL**  
Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all claims so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,
