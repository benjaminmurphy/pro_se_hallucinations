**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT DEPARTMENT**  
**NORFOLK DIVISION**  

**DOCKET NO. __________**  

**JESSICA THOMPSON,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MICHAEL SMITH,**  
Defendant.  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

The Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the Judgment of Custody entered on May 15, 2021, and for support, states as follows:  

---

**I. PARTIES**  

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, resides at [your address] in [your city], Commonwealth of Massachusetts. She is the primary physical custodian of the minor children, Emma Smith, age 8, and Liam Smith, age 6.

2. The Defendant, Michael Smith, resides at [his address] in [his city], Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  

---

**II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 209C, § 20, as both parties and the minor children reside in Massachusetts.

4. Venue is proper in the Norfolk Probate and Family Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1, as the children reside in Norfolk County.  

---

**III. BACKGROUND AND EXISTING ORDER**  

5. On May 15, 2021, this Court issued a custody order granting the Plaintiff primary physical custody of the parties' minor children with the Defendant receiving parenting time on alternate weekends and one midweek visit.

6. At the time the custody order was entered, neither party was in a relationship with a new partner, and the issue of third-party involvement in parenting time was not addressed.  

---

**IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**  

7. Since the entry of the existing custody order, the Defendant has begun cohabiting with an individual who poses a serious risk to the health and welfare of the minor children, necessitating a modification of the existing judgment.  

8. Upon information and belief, the Defendant’s live-in partner has a criminal history, including convictions for assault and battery in violation of G.L. c. 265, § 13A, and has been the subject of a prior restraining order issued under G.L. c. 209A.  

9. The Plaintiff has observed and been informed of the following incidents of concern involving the Defendant’s partner while the children were in the Defendant’s care:  

   a. The children, Emma and Liam, have reported that the individual frequently yells, slams doors, and engages in hostile behavior in the Defendant’s home.  

   b. On or about October 10, 2025, the Plaintiff observed a bruise on Emma’s arm after a visit. Emma reported that the individual “grabbed her arm” during an argument.  

   c. On November 18, 2025, law enforcement responded to the Defendant’s residence after a neighbor reported a loud domestic argument while the minor children were present.  

10. The behavior of the Defendant's live-in partner constitutes a material change in circumstances that endangers the physical and emotional well-being of the minor children.  

11. The Massachusetts Legislature, in enacting G.L. c. 208, § 31, emphasized that the "best interests of the child" are the paramount consideration in custody determinations.  

12. The safety of minor children is of such importance that this Court has consistently modified custody orders to protect them from exposure to domestic violence, substance abuse, or unsafe environments. See Hunter v. Rose, 463 Mass. 488 (2012); Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).  

13. Massachusetts courts recognize that significant instability or risk of harm in the custodial environment justifies modification of custody orders. See Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981); Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).  

14. A material change in circumstances, such as the introduction of a potentially dangerous individual into the Defendant’s household, warrants reconsideration of the current visitation schedule to protect the welfare of the minor children. See Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); Hernandez v. Branciforte, 55 Mass. App. Ct. 212 (2002).  

---

**V. REQUEST FOR RELIEF**  

15. The Plaintiff requests that this Court modify the existing custody order to ensure the safety and well-being of the minor children. Specifically, the Plaintiff requests that:  

   a. The Defendant be prohibited from allowing his live-in partner or any other third party who poses a risk to the minor children to be present during his parenting time; or  

   b. In the alternative, the Defendant’s parenting time be modified to require that visits be supervised by an appropriate third party, agency, or facility; and  

   c. Such other and further relief as may be just and proper.  

---

**VI. BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILDREN**  

16. This request for modification is made in the best interests of the minor children, consistent with G.L. c. 208, § 31 and relevant Massachusetts caselaw. The current arrangement exposes the children to potential harm and emotional distress, which must be addressed to ensure their health, safety, and welfare. See Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010).  

---

**VII. RELIEF SOUGHT**  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Conduct a hearing on the instant Complaint for Modification;  

2. Modify the existing custody judgment to restrict the Defendant from allowing his live-in partner to be present during his parenting time or, alternatively, impose supervision requirements;  

3. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

Respectfully submitted,  
**Jessica Thompson**
