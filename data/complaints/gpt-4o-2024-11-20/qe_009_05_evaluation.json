Although the provided text does not itself contain that language, the case is correctly cited in Massachusetts practice for that proposition, and the holding aligns with the claimed rule about substantial interference with tenants\u2019 use and enjoyment. Because the quoted portion is not the operative majority language on quiet enjoyment, confidence is medium rather than high.",

While the opinion recites general principles that quiet enjoyment protects against serious interference and that landlords can be liable where they negligently fail to alleviate conditions, this case finds the opposite on its facts and thus does not itself stand as authority imposing liability. It therefore does not support the proposition that Massachusetts courts have held landlords liable when their failure to remedy unsafe or uninhabitable conditions causes substantial interference; instead, it is an example where liability was rejected.",

New Bedford Hous. Authy., 417 Mass. 273, 285 (1994). Generally, the landlord must have had notice of the condition interfering with the tenant\u2019s quiet enjoyment of the premises, and he must have at least acted negligently in not alleviating the condition. See Al-Ziab v. Mourgis, 424 Mass. 847, 850-851 (1997).

The opinion squarely holds that a landlord has a duty to maintain habitable, watertight premises under the State Sanitary Code and G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, and that Gem\u2019s failure over time to remedy repeated flooding/sewage conditions made it liable for the tenant\u2019s resulting personal and emotional injuries and statutory remedies. While the facts involve flooding rather than, say, heat or electricity, the case clearly treats the landlord\u2019s omission to remedy a serious, code-violating condition as a compensable failure to provide essential, sanitary housing conditions, fitting the proposition\u2019s gist.",
