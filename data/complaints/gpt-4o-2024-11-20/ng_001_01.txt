### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

5. On September 16, 2023, Plaintiff was lawfully shopping as an invitee at Defendant's grocery store located at 123 Dairy Ave., Somerville, MA 02144.  
6. While in the dairy aisle, Plaintiff stepped into a large puddle of spilled milk and slipped, suffering a hard fall onto her right side.  
7. Upon information and belief, the puddle of milk had been present on the floor for a prolonged period, as evidenced by visible shopping cart tracks going through the spilled liquid.  
8. No wet floor signs, cones, or other warnings were in place to alert Plaintiff or other customers to the hazardous condition of the floor.  
9. An employee of Defendant was stocking shelves approximately fifteen feet from the puddle at the time of Plaintiff’s fall. The employee admitted to Plaintiff that he had noticed the spill “a few minutes ago” but had not yet addressed the hazard because he was completing another task.  
10. Plaintiff suffered immediate pain to her hip following the fall but initially believed the injury was minor and continued shopping.  
11. Plaintiff later experienced worsening pain that evening and sought medical attention at urgent care the following day, where she was diagnosed with a hip sprain.  
12. Plaintiff’s injury necessitated physical therapy and caused her to miss several shifts at her job as a café employee.  
13. Plaintiff’s medical expenses amount to approximately $1,200, and her lost wages are approximately $1,800.  
14. Defendant breached its duty of care owed to Plaintiff as a business invitee by:  
    a. Failing to inspect the premises for hazardous conditions in a reasonable and timely manner;  
    b. Failing to promptly clean or remove the spilled milk;  
    c. Failing to place cones, wet floor signs, or other warnings around the hazardous condition;  
    d. Failing to adhere to store policies and procedures regarding maintenance of the premises; and  
    e. Failing to adequately train employees to identify, report, and/or resolve hazardous conditions in a timely manner.  
15. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent conduct, Plaintiff sustained injuries and damages as set forth above.

### IV. CAUSES OF ACTION  
**COUNT I: NEGLIGENCE**  

16. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  
17. Under Massachusetts law, Defendant owed Plaintiff, a business invitee, a duty to use reasonable care to maintain its premises in a safe condition and to warn of or eliminate risks of harm that were known or reasonably foreseeable. _See Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.,_ 363 Mass. 165, 167 (1973).  
18. Defendant breached this duty of care by failing to address the spilled milk, failing to warn Plaintiff and other invitees of the hazard, and failing to take reasonable actions consistent with its obligations under premises liability law.  
19. Massachusetts law further establishes that a store owner must inspect and remedy hazardous conditions within a reasonable time. _See Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.,_ 448 Mass. 780, 788 (2007). Defendant’s employee admitted to knowing about the spill but failed to act in a timely fashion to address it, foreseeably putting Plaintiff and others at risk.  
20. A property owner is liable where its failure to act caused a dangerous condition that foreseeably led to an injury, _see Berube v. Economy Grocery Stores Corp.,_ 315 Mass. 89, 93 (1943), which is precisely what occurred here.  
21. Massachusetts courts recognize that a property owner may be held liable if an employee’s negligence, in the course of their duties, leads to harm. _See Mullins v. Pine Manor Coll.,_ 389 Mass. 47, 57 (1983). Here, Defendant’s employee was aware of and failed to promptly clean the spill, directly contributing to Plaintiff’s fall.  
22. Defendant’s negligent conduct was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries, as recognized under Massachusetts law. _See G.L. c. 231, § 85._  
23. Plaintiff incurred damages as a result of Defendant’s failure to fulfill its legal obligations, including medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering, consistent with principles of damages as outlined in _O’Brien v. Pearson,_ 449 Mass. 377, 384 (2007).

### V. DAMAGES AND PRAYER FOR RELIEF  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Thompson requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Grocer’s Market Inc., and award the following relief:  

1. Compensatory damages in the amount of $3,000, representing $1,200 in medical expenses and $1,800 in lost wages, or such amount as may be proven at trial;  
2. Damages for pain and suffering in an amount to be determined at trial;  
3. Prejudgment interest pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B;
