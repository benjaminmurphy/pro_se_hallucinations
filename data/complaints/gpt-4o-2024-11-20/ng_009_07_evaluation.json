It does not involve landlord-tenant relationships, statutory safety measures, or liability for personal injuries. The holding is that the board\u2019s contract for legal services was invalid for lack of appropriation, which is unrelated to the proposed rule about landlord liability for failures to maintain statutory safety measures.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cIt is plain from the provisions of the city charter of the defendant that the local licensing board had no power to make expenditures beyond the appropriations previously voted. Therefore any indebtedness incurred by the licensing board in excess of its appropriation was illegal and void. It follows that the local licensing board had no authority to employ counsel in the proceedings in question since no appropriation had been previously made for it.\u201d"

It does not involve landlord-tenant relations, statutory safety measures, or tort liability for injuries. The holding is about breach of contract and measure of damages, so it does not provide authority for the proposition that Massachusetts landlords may be held liable for injuries arising from failure to maintain statutory safety measures.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"Upon the agreed facts, although the defendant committed no breach of the sale agreement (as we have construed it) in selling the real estate partly for credit and partly for cash, he did clearly commit a breach of contract by refusing to account to the plaintiff for all the proceeds of the sale. He was bound by his contract to pay or transfer to the plaintiff the proceeds in excess of his commission and expenses and the encumbrances.\""

Therefore, it provides no authority for the proposition that Massachusetts landlords may be held liable for injuries arising from failures to maintain statutory safety measures.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "The case focuses on whether parcels in different towns can be combined to satisfy zoning lot-size requirements and on the preclusive effect of an earlier zoning board decision. There is no discussion of landlord liability, tenant injuries, or statutory safety measures."
