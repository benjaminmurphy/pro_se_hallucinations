Instead, the court affirms an award of sole custody to the mother and explains why joint custody (which it equates with joint decision\u2011making) is inappropriate given the parties\u2019 inability to cooperate. While the opinion discusses that joint custody requires cooperation and joint decision\u2011making, it does not articulate or enforce any rule that a parent with shared legal custody must obtain the other parent\u2019s agreement before enrolling children in activities, so it does not support the specific proposition cited.",
