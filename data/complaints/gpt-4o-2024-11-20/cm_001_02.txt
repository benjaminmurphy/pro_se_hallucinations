Samantha Johnson, Plaintiff  

v.  

Michael Johnson, Defendant  

**_________________________________________**  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

**INTRODUCTION**  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Samantha Johnson, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody and parenting schedule entered on May 15, 2020. Due to a material and substantial change in circumstances concerning the Defendant's employment schedule and its direct impact on his ability to exercise parenting time in a manner consistent with the children's best interests, Plaintiff requests this Court to issue a modified custody order.  

This Complaint is brought pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws c. 208, § 28, and relevant authority, as detailed below.  

**PARTIES**  

1. **Plaintiff**: Samantha Johnson, of Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, is the mother of the minor children concerned in this matter, Emily Johnson (DOB: June 12, 2017) and Ethan Johnson (DOB: December 4, 2019). Plaintiff has primary physical custody under the current parenting plan.  
2. **Defendant**: Michael Johnson, of Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, is the father of the minor children and is currently entitled to parenting time every other weekend, and one overnight during the week, pursuant to the parenting order entered by this Court.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

3. Jurisdiction is proper under Massachusetts General Laws c. 209C and c. 208, §§ 28 and 31, as the parties are residents of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and this Court has continuing jurisdiction over matters related to the custody of the parties’ minor children.  
4. Venue is proper in Middlesex Probate and Family Court pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws c. 223, § 1, as both parties reside within Middlesex County.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

5. On May 15, 2020, this Court entered a parenting schedule granting joint legal custody of Emily Johnson and Ethan Johnson to the parties, with Plaintiff having primary physical custody. The Defendant was awarded parenting time every other weekend and one overnight during the week.  
6. At the time of the original custody order, both Plaintiff and Defendant worked regular daytime schedules, making the parenting plan practical and workable for the parties and the best interests of the children.  
7. Since approximately September 1, 2025, Defendant has been employed in a new position in which he works a night shift from 7:00 PM to 7:00 AM several nights a week, including many of the evenings during which he is scheduled to have parenting time under the current order.  
8. Defendant’s new work schedule has caused repeated disruptions in the parenting schedule:  
   a. Defendant has regularly dropped the children off at Plaintiff's home with little or no notice because he is reportedly too tired to care for them after his shifts.  
   b. Defendant has, on occasion, left the children in the care of his roommate, a person with whom Plaintiff and the children are not familiar, and without Plaintiff’s consent.  
   c. The children, Emily and Ethan, have reported that during their time with Defendant, they often fall asleep on the couch while Defendant naps after his overnight shifts, reducing the quality of their time with him.  
9. These developments are not only disruptive to the children’s stability but also pose concerns regarding their safety and emotional well-being.  
10. Plaintiff has attempted to communicate with Defendant to resolve these issues and establish a mutually agreed-upon parenting plan in light of his new work schedule, but those attempts have been unsuccessful.  

**MODIFICATION IS NECESSARY AND IN THE CHILDREN’S BEST INTERESTS**  

11. Plaintiff alleges that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances—the Defendant’s work schedule—rendering the current parenting arrangement impractical and not in the children’s best interests, as required by Massachusetts General Laws c. 208, § 28.  
12. Under Massachusetts law, custody arrangements must promote the best interests of the child. See *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985). Defendant’s current work schedule leaves him with limited capacity to ensure the children’s safety, proper supervision, and meaningful interaction during his parenting time.  
13. It is well-established that the stability and continuity of a child’s environment are significant factors in determining their best interests. See *D.M. v. J.E.*, 2 Mass. App. Ct. 619 (1974). The current situation is disruptive to the children’s routine and stability.  
14. While joint custody arrangements like this one presume a level of cooperation between parents, as required under *Beal v. Beal*, 429 Mass. 157 (1999), Defendant’s conduct demonstrates an inability to adhere to the current arrangements due to his new employment.  

**RELIEF REQUESTED**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:  
1. Modify the existing custody and parenting order entered on May 15, 2020, to:  
   a. Adjust Defendant’s parenting time to limit overnight visits to nights when he is not scheduled to work overnight shifts.  
   b. Ensure that all child care responsibilities during Defendant's parenting time are carried out directly by Defendant unless the Plaintiff consents to alternative arrangements in advance.  
   c. Include any additional provisions this Court finds necessary to promote the safety, well-being, and stability of the minor children.  
2. Grant such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.  

**CONCLUSION**  

The Plaintiff would respectfully submit that the circumstances underlying the prior parenting order have materially changed and that modification of the custody arrangement is essential to serve the best interests of Emily Johnson and Ethan Johnson.  

Respectfully submitted,  

**Samantha Johnson**
