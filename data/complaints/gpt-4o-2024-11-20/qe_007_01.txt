**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**CAMBRIDGE DISTRICT COURT**  
____  
**AVERY JOHNSON,**  
*Plaintiff,*  
vs.  
**MARK THOMPSON,**  
*Defendant.*  
____  
**Civil Action No. __________**  

**COMPLAINT**  

**I. PARTIES**  
1. Plaintiff, Avery Johnson ("Plaintiff"), resides at 45 Elm Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, where they have been a residential tenant since May 1, 2022.  
2. Defendant, Mark Thompson ("Defendant"), is the owner and landlord of the property located at 45 Elm Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139.  

**II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, § 3, which confers jurisdiction upon district courts for actions involving residential landlord-tenant disputes.  
4. Venue is proper in this Court under G.L. c. 223, § 1 because the Plaintiff's residence, the subject premises, is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  

**III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
5. Plaintiff rents the unit at 45 Elm Street under a written lease agreement with Defendant, which commenced on May 1, 2022. Plaintiff pays $2,200 per month in rent.  
6. Beginning approximately October 1, 2025, Defendant commenced substantial renovation work on the apartment unit adjacent to Plaintiff’s apartment.  
7. For the past two months, construction noise, including drilling, hammering, and loud conversations by construction workers, has occurred on weekdays from approximately 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM.  
8. The continuous noise has interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy their rental unit, particularly because Plaintiff works from home and has difficulty concentrating on calls and completing work tasks due to the noise.  
9. In addition to the persistent noise, dust infiltrates Plaintiff’s apartment through the ventilation system, creating an additional unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of the premises.  
10. Despite being notified of the renovation plans in advance, Plaintiff did not consent to the ongoing invasion of their quiet enjoyment.  
11. Defendant offered Plaintiff a $100 reduction in rent for one month, which is insufficient to compensate for the ongoing interference with Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment of the rental unit.  
12. Defendant’s conduct constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied under Massachusetts law because the persistent noise, dust, and disruption have rendered the Plaintiff’s use of the premises substantially impaired.  
13. Plaintiff has suffered damages as a result of Defendant’s actions, including, but not limited to, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, and the inability to fully utilize their home as a place of work and residence.  

**IV. CLAIM FOR RELIEF: BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**  
14. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 13 as if fully stated herein.  
15. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Massachusetts law provides tenants with the right to quiet enjoyment of their rental unit, prohibiting landlords from engaging in acts or omissions that substantially interfere with a tenant's use and enjoyment of the premises.  
16. The ongoing construction noise, dust infiltration, and disruption caused by the Defendant’s renovation activities are violations of Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment of the premises under G.L. c. 186, § 14.  
17. Defendant’s actions and omissions causing such interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of their apartment constitute an intentional or negligent breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in Plaintiff’s tenancy.  
18. The interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment is not minor nor incidental but has persisted continuously for over two months and is anticipated to continue for an additional month or more.  
19. Plaintiff has been damaged by Defendant’s conduct in the form of lost working productivity, emotional distress, and inability to enjoy normal use of their living space.    

**V. LEGAL AUTHORITY**  
20. G.L. c. 186, § 14 establishes that tenants have a right to quiet enjoyment of their property and allows a tenant damaged by a landlord’s violation of this right to recover monetary damages.  
21. In *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982), the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts held that a landlord breaches the covenant of quiet enjoyment when their conduct or omissions render the leased premises substantially unsuitable for the purposes for which they are rented.  
22. The Court in *Doe v. New Bedford Housing Authority*, 417 Mass. 273, 285 (1994), affirmed that tenants are entitled to compensation for interference with their quiet enjoyment of the premises caused by the landlord’s unreasonable actions.  
23. *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847, 850 (1997), reiterated that the covenant of quiet enjoyment protects a tenant’s right to undisturbed use and occupancy and that plaintiffs can recover damages for its violation.  
24. In *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714, 715-718 (1977), the Court held that landlords are responsible for unreasonable interferences with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment, even when caused by third parties under the landlord’s control.  
25. The dust infiltration into Plaintiff’s unit constitutes a physical intrusion that supports a claim for breach of quiet enjoyment, as upheld in *Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184, 200 (1973).  
26. Massachusetts landlord-tenant laws codified under G.L. c. 239, § 8A provide additional protections to tenants, emphasizing the importance of the covenant of quiet enjoyment in residential leases.  
27. The Defendant’s conduct also constitutes a violation of the implied warranty of habitability described in *Burlington v. District Court*, 382 Mass. 159 (1980), to the extent the dust and persistent disruption affect habitable conditions.  
28. Defendant’s failure to adequately resolve these disruptions, beyond an insufficient rent reduction, is an unreasonable response under established Massachusetts case law principles.  

**VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:  
A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff, finding that Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14;  
B. Award Plaintiff damages in the amount of $800, or such other amount as the Court determines to be just and equitable;  
C. Award Plaintiff costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in bringing this action, as provided by G.L. c. 186, § 14;  
D. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

**Respectfully submitted,**  
Dated: December 1, 2025.
