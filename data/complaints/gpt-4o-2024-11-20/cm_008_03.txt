**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**

**BRISTOL COUNTY PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT**

**DOCKET NO. ___________________**

____________________________________  
**Laura Martinez**, Plaintiff  
vs.  
**Mark Johnson**, Defendant  
____________________________________  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Laura Martinez, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court to modify the Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time issued on May 15, 2022, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws c. 208, § 28 and c. 209C, § 20. In support thereof, Plaintiff states as follows:

---

### **I. PARTIES**  

1. **Plaintiff**: Laura Martinez resides at [address omitted], in [city/town], Bristol County, Massachusetts. She is the mother of the minor child, Sofia Johnson, born [DOB omitted].  

2. **Defendant**: Mark Johnson resides at [address omitted], in [city/town], Bristol County, Massachusetts. He is the father of the minor child, Sofia Johnson.  

---

### **II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 209C, § 20, as this action involves modification of a custody and parenting-time judgment.  

4. Venue is proper in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 8 because both parties and the child reside within this jurisdiction.  

---

### **III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

5. The existing custody and parenting-time judgment, entered by this Court on May 15, 2022, provides that the parties share legal custody of the minor child, Sofia Johnson, with Plaintiff being the primary residential parent and Defendant having substantial weekend time, including overnights on Sunday.  

6. The judgment further requires both parties to cooperate on matters pertaining to Sofia’s education and to keep each other informed. At the time of the judgment, Sofia was performing adequately in school and had no known attendance or academic challenges.  

7. Over the past year, Defendant has repeatedly failed to ensure that Sofia attends school on Mondays following his parenting weekends, under the pretense that she “needs a mental health day.” These absences are not supported by medical documentation or a specific mental health diagnosis, nor are they discussed with or consented to by Plaintiff.  

8. As a direct result of these absences, Sofia has received truancy warnings from her school, and her grades and overall academic performance have declined markedly.  

9. Despite Sofia being enrolled in tutoring to address her educational struggles, Defendant regularly neglects to bring her to tutoring sessions that fall during his parenting time, further jeopardizing her academic success.  

10. Defendant’s pattern of behavior constitutes a failure to prioritize Sofia’s educational needs, as required by the parties’ shared legal custody arrangement.  

11. This material change in circumstances—the decline in Sofia’s academic performance and the Defendant’s failure to act in her best interests—warrants a modification of the custody and parenting-time arrangement to protect Sofia’s welfare.  

---

### **IV. REQUESTED RELIEF**  

12. Plaintiff requests that the Court modify the judgment by:  

   a. Granting Plaintiff sole or final decision-making authority regarding Sofia’s school attendance and academic matters; or  

   b. Reducing Defendant’s Sunday overnight parenting time to ensure Sofia is prepared for school on Mondays and minimizing disruptions to her attendance.  

13. Such a modification is consistent with Sofia’s best interests, which is the paramount consideration under G.L. c. 208, § 31.  

---

### **V. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION**  

14. A modification of custody or parenting time requires a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and that the proposed modification will serve the best interests of the child. (See *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); *Schechter v. Schechter*, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015)).  

15. The decline in Sofia’s school attendance and academic performance constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the original judgment (*Custody of Zia*, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 237 (2000); G.L. c. 208, § 28).  

16. The Defendant’s failure to cooperate in fostering Sofia’s educational well-being violates the obligations of shared legal custody (*Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012)). Shared legal custody requires joint responsibility for decisions affecting the child’s welfare, including education. (See *Gilmore v. Gilmore*, 369 Mass. 598 (1976)).  

17. It is well-established that the child’s best interests must guide all custody determinations. The Court must consider the child’s physical, emotional, and educational needs (*Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003)).  

18. Ensuring Sofia’s regular school attendance and access to tutoring is essential to her best interests and academic development (*Morrow v. Morrow*, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 1 (2000)).  

19. Modifying the current judgment to grant Plaintiff final authority over educational matters or to reduce Defendant’s parenting time on school nights is appropriate to address these concerns (*Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001)).  

---

### **VI. REQUEST FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred;  

2. Modify the Judgment of Custody and Parenting Time entered on May 15, 2022, to:  

   a. Grant Plaintiff sole or final decision-making authority over Sofia’s educational matters; and/or  
   b. Reduce Defendant’s Sunday overnight parenting time to ensure Sofia’s regular school attendance;  

3. Award Plaintiff such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.
