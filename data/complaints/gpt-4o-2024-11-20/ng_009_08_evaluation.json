The SJC holds that a homeowner who allows guns to be stored on her property and grants unsupervised access to a person known to be violent and mentally unstable owes a duty of reasonable care to ensure those guns are properly secured, grounding that duty in both foreseeability and premises-control concepts. This aligns with the proposition that Jupin discusses landlord (or landowner) liability for dangerous conditions on premises under their control.",

This duty is owed to, inter alia, a law enforcement officer shot by the person granted unsupervised access, because the officer is a foreseeable victim of the alleged improper firearm storage.\u201d"

The portion cited at page 169 announces a general negligence standard for landlords as to defects on leased premises; common-area duties had already been recognized in earlier cases like Lindsey and King and are described as background. Thus, the case is broader than and not specifically a holding limited to common areas, so the proposition as phrased is inaccurate.",
