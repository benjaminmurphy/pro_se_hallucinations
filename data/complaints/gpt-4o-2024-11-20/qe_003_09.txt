**LAURA SIMMONS**,  
Plaintiff,  
 
v.  
 
**DAVID THOMPSON**,  
Defendant.

Plaintiff Laura Simmons (“Plaintiff”), for her Complaint against Defendant David Thompson (“Defendant”), hereby states and alleges as follows:

---

### PARTIES

1. Plaintiff Laura Simmons is an individual who resides at 25 Green Street, Apartment 2, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130.  

2. Defendant David Thompson is the landlord and property owner of 25 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130, and is responsible for managing and maintaining the premises rented by Plaintiff.

---

### JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, § 3, as the dispute arises out of the landlord-tenant relationship and pertains to residential premises located in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.  

4. Venue is proper in this Court because the subject property is located at 25 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, and the Defendant conducts business in Boston, Suffolk County.  

---

### FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about February 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a written lease agreement with Defendant to rent a studio apartment located at 25 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts (the “Apartment”), for a monthly rent of $1,500.  

6. At the time of the lease execution, Plaintiff observed water stains on the ceiling of the Apartment and inquired about their cause. Defendant stated that the stains were from a prior water leak that had been “totally fixed.”  

7. Relying on Defendant’s representations, Plaintiff entered into the lease agreement.  

8. Shortly after moving in, during the first significant rainstorm, the ceiling in the Apartment began to leak water at the same location as the stains.  

9. Plaintiff promptly reported the leak to Defendant, who dismissed it as a “minor cosmetic issue.”  

10. The leak has continued for the entire duration of Plaintiff’s tenancy and, during subsequent rainstorms, worsened to the point that water soaked Plaintiff’s couch and damaged a laptop left on her coffee table, causing a loss of $900.  

11. Despite repeated complaints by Plaintiff, Defendant has failed and refused to make repairs to stop the leak or mitigate its effects. Defendant has instead characterized the issue as part of the “character” of the Apartment.  

12. As a result of Defendant’s failure to address the leak, the Apartment has developed a persistent musty smell, supporting the reasonable conclusion that mold is growing in the premises.  

13. Plaintiff has suffered adverse health effects, including frequent headaches, plausibly caused by mold exposure.  

14. Due to the ongoing condition of the Apartment, Plaintiff has been forced to rearrange her furniture and avoid portions of the premises, effectively depriving her of the use and enjoyment of a substantial portion of her rental unit.  

15. Defendant’s refusal to remedy the defect constitutes a violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in all residential leases pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 and recognized under Massachusetts common law.

### CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

16. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 through 15 as if fully set forth herein.  

17. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, and Massachusetts case law, every residential lease includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, guaranteeing tenants the right to use and enjoy the premises free from substantial interference caused by the landlord or persons acting under the landlord’s control. See *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273, 285 (1994).  

18. Defendant has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Apartment by failing to repair the persistent leak in the ceiling, leading to water damage, a musty smell potentially caused by mold, and other adverse living conditions.  

19. Defendant’s inaction has deprived Plaintiff of the full and comfortable use of her rental unit, forcing her to endure the loss of livable space and health hazards in violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 102 (1982).  

20. Defendant’s conduct was willful and knowing, as he repeatedly dismissed Plaintiff’s complaints and refused to remedy the defect despite being fully aware of the ongoing issues.  

21. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s actions, Plaintiff has suffered damages, including but not limited to the loss of use of her Apartment, property damage, and health concerns. See *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847, 850 (1997); *Armstrong v. Collella*, 2001 Mass. App. Div. 189, 191.

### PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

A. Enter judgment against Defendant for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14;  

B. Award Plaintiff damages in the amount of $900 for property loss, plus an amount to be determined at trial for the diminution in use and enjoyment of the Apartment and related discomfort and health issues;  

C. Award Plaintiff attorneys’ fees and costs as permitted by G.L. c. 186, § 14;  

D. Award Plaintiff any enhanced or treble damages provided by statute for Defendant’s knowing and willful breaches of the covenant of quiet enjoyment; and
