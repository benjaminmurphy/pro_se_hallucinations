---

### **I. INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**

1. **Plaintiff**: Jessica Harmon ("Plaintiff") is an individual residing in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.  
   
2. **Defendant**: Thomas Richards ("Defendant") is an individual who owns the residential property located at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts 01201.  

3. This is a personal injury cause of action sounding in negligence. The incident giving rise to this claim occurred on or about August 15, 2023, at or near Defendant's property.  

---

### **II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 212, § 4 because Plaintiff seeks monetary damages well in excess of $25,000 as compensation for injuries sustained due to Defendant's negligent acts.  

5. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223, § 1, as the alleged incident occurred in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, Berkshire County, and Defendant resides and conducts activities there.  

---

### **III. STATEMENT OF FACTS**

6. Plaintiff regularly walks along the residential street in front of 123 Maple Street in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, where Defendant owns and resides at the subject property.

7. A large, mature maple tree is located on the Defendant's property, and a substantial branch of this tree extended over the public sidewalk used by pedestrians.  

8. Prior to August 15, 2023, Defendant had notice that a major branch on the tree had become cracked, droopy, and hazardous, such that it posed a foreseeable risk of falling and harming pedestrians.  

   a. Plaintiff had personally observed the branch’s deteriorating condition over time.  
   
   b. Neighbors of the Defendant advised Defendant of the hazardous condition and informed Defendant that the branch required inspection and likely removal by an arborist.  

9. Despite this actual and constructive notice of the dangerous condition, Defendant negligently failed to take reasonable steps to inspect, maintain, or remove the hazardous branch.  

10. On August 15, 2023, during a routine thunderstorm with normal wind patterns, the cracked branch suddenly broke from the tree and fell onto Plaintiff, who was walking on the adjacent sidewalk while carrying grocery bags.  

11. As a result of the branch falling, Plaintiff suffered physical injuries, including but not limited to:  

   a. A shoulder strain, for which Plaintiff sought medical treatment; and  
   b. Multiple bruises along her back and shoulders.  

12. Plaintiff incurred necessary medical expenses in the approximate amount of $1,200 and lost approximately $500 in wages after missing one week of employment as a result of her injuries.

### **IV. CAUSE OF ACTION: NEGLIGENCE**

13. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all prior paragraphs in this Complaint as if fully restated here.  

14. Under Massachusetts law, Defendant owed a duty of care to all lawful users of the public sidewalk adjacent to his property, including Plaintiff, to ensure that hazardous conditions caused by trees on his property did not pose an unreasonable risk of harm.  

15. Defendant breached this duty of care by failing to:  

   a. Inspect the at-risk branch for structural weaknesses;  
   b. Remove or prune the hazardous branch despite obvious signs of potential failure; and  
   c. Act upon repeated warnings from neighbors about the dangerous condition of the tree.  

16. Defendant’s breach of duty was a proximate cause of the injuries sustained by Plaintiff. But for Defendant’s negligent failure to remedy the hazardous branch, Plaintiff would not have been injured.  

17. Plaintiff’s injuries and damages were foreseeable consequences of Defendant’s negligent conduct.  

18. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered damages, including:  

   a. Medical expenses of approximately $1,200;  
   b. Lost wages of approximately $500;  
   c. Physical pain and suffering; and  
   d. Emotional distress.  

---

### **V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Harmon respectfully requests that this honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:  

1. Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but no less than $25,000, for medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and emotional distress caused by Defendant’s negligence;  

2. Award Plaintiff costs and expenses incurred in this action, including any applicable interest allowed by law; and  

3. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.  

---

### **VI. JURY DEMAND**

Pursuant to Rule 38 of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

---

### **VII. LEGAL SUPPORT**
