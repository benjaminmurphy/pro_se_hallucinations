The court reverses a plaintiff\u2019s verdict and orders judgment for the defendant, emphasizing that the characteristics of the substance and timing did not permit an inference that the defendant\u2019s employees created it or should have discovered it.

Instead, the court holds that, under the newly adopted mode-of-operation doctrine, the store is deemed to have notice of inherent risks associated with its self-service operation, independent of proof that employees recognized the specific hazard at issue. Thus, the case supports notice via mode of operation, not via employee acknowledgment of a specific hazardous puddle.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cIn sum, the adoption of the mode of operation approach will not modify the general rule governing premises liability requiring a plaintiff to prove that an owner had either actual or constructive notice of an unsafe condition on the premises. However, if a plaintiff proves that an unsafe condition on an owner\u2019s premises exists that was reasonably foreseeable, resulting from an owner\u2019s self-service business or mode of operation, and the plaintiff slips as a result of the unsafe condition, the plaintiff will satisfy the notice requirement.\u201d"

That is the opposite of finding that defendant failed to act with reasonable care; instead, the court (and concurring justice) found the evidence was insufficient to present a negligence question to the jury. Thus, the opinion undermines, rather than supports, the claimed proposition of negligence for failure to resolve the hazard.",
