### COMPLAINT  

The Plaintiff, Jessica Morales, by and through herself, brings this Complaint against the Defendant, Tracy Hargrove, and alleges as follows:  

---

#### I. JURISDICTION AND VENUE  

1. This action is brought under Massachusetts law and alleges negligence.  

2. The subject matter of this action concerns personal injuries sustained by the Plaintiff as a result of the Defendant's failure to adequately address a dangerously icy sidewalk on property owned by the Defendant, located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts.  

3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to **G.L. c. 212, § 4**, as the damages exceed $25,000 in controversy.  

4. Venue is proper in Worcester County under **G.L. c. 223, § 1**, because the incident occurred in Worcester and the Defendant resides or conducts business in Worcester.

---

#### II. PARTIES  

5. The Plaintiff, Jessica Morales, is an adult individual residing in [provide Plaintiff’s city or town], Massachusetts.  

6. The Defendant, Tracy Hargrove, is the owner of the property located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts, and was at all relevant times responsible for its maintenance and care.

---

#### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

7. On or about February 15, 2023, Jessica Morales was lawfully and reasonably delivering groceries to a tenant who resided at the Defendant’s property located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts.  

8. The Defendant had a duty, under Massachusetts law, to exercise reasonable care in maintaining the premises and adjacent sidewalks to prevent unreasonable risks of harm to lawful visitors and passersby.  

9. At the time of the incident, snow and ice had accumulated on the sidewalk abutting the Defendant’s property as a result of a storm several days prior.  

10. Though the Defendant had cleared a narrow pathway on the sidewalk, she failed to apply salt, sand, or any other measures to mitigate the formation of ice, despite her actual or constructive knowledge that refreezing of melted snow was likely to occur overnight.  

11. Over the course of several days, the cleared pathway became a sheet of ice due to the melting of snow during daytime hours followed by freezing temperatures during the night.  

12. The Defendant had actual knowledge of this dangerous ice condition, as tenants residing at her property texted her about the hazard and even sent her photographs.  

13. Despite such notice, the Defendant negligently failed to address the hazardous condition, responding instead that “the sun will take care of it.”  

14. On February 15, 2023, while delivering groceries to one of the Defendant’s tenants, the Plaintiff was walking along the cleared pathway on the sidewalk abutting the Defendant's property when she encountered the ice patch, causing her to slip, fall backward, and land on her lower back.  

15. As a direct and proximate result of the Defendant’s negligence in failing to address the icy sidewalk, the Plaintiff sustained a lower back injury, incurring medical expenses and lost wages, and experiencing pain and suffering.  

16. Specifically, Jessica Morales sustained approximately $1,500 in medical expenses and lost approximately $1,000 in wages due to her inability to work for one week following the incident.

#### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION: NEGLIGENCE  

17. The Plaintiff restates and re-alleges each preceding paragraph as if fully set forth herein.  

18. Defendant owed a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the premises and sidewalk adjacent to her property in a reasonably safe condition, including by removing or mitigating any snow or ice hazards, pursuant to Massachusetts law. (**Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693 (1973); **Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.**, 457 Mass. 368 (2010)).  

19. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 85, § 5**, property owners are responsible for maintaining sidewalks abutting their property free of dangerous snow and ice conditions.  

20. Defendant breached this duty by failing to properly maintain the sidewalk abutting her property, failing to adequately remove or treat snow and ice, and failing to implement reasonable measures to ensure the safety of lawful visitors, despite actual notice of the dangerous condition.  

21. Defendant’s conduct was unreasonable under the circumstances, particularly in light of the fact that simple and minimal measures, such as the application of salt or sand, would have eliminated or significantly reduced the hazard. (**Halley v. Hugh Nawn, Inc.**, 356 Mass. 28 (1969)).  

22. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, the Plaintiff sustained serious bodily injury, incurring both economic and non-economic damages.  

23. Plaintiff was lawfully on the sidewalk for a business-related purpose at the time of the incident and had no reasonable notice of the danger posed by the icy pathway. (**Schwartz v. Com.,** 419 Mass. 306 (1995); **Souza v. Walgreens East Inc.**, 84 Mass. App. Ct. 381 (2013)).  

24. Under Massachusetts law, a property owner’s knowledge of a hazardous condition, combined with a failure to take reasonable actions to remedy that condition, constitutes actionable negligence. (**Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.**, 448 Mass. 780 (2007); **Monsour v. Haney**, 284 Mass. 267 (1933)).  

25. Defendant’s failure to act in a reasonable manner constitutes a violation of her legal duty, and she is therefore liable for the Plaintiff’s injuries.  

---

#### V. DAMAGES  

26. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, the Plaintiff has sustained:  
   a. Medical expenses in the amount of approximately $1,500;  
   b. Lost wages in the amount of approximately $1,000; and  
   c. Physical pain and suffering, emotional distress, and other non-economic damages.  

27. Plaintiff reserves the right to amend this Complaint to specify the full amount of damages after further investigation and discovery.  

---

#### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Morales respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Award damages to the Plaintiff in an amount to be determined at trial, including but not limited to:  
   a. Past and future medical expenses;  
   b. Lost wages and lost earning capacity;  
   c. Physical pain and suffering;  
   d. Emotional distress; and  
   e. Costs of litigation.  

2. Award interest, attorney’s fees, and such other relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

---
