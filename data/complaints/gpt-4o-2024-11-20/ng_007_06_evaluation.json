The court discusses general negligence and landowner duties, as well as voluntarily assumed duties, but it ultimately holds that the defendant owed no duty to provide additional safety measures beyond hiring police. It does not address or establish any rule about supervising children in organized programs, so using it to support that specific duty of care is inaccurate.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cBefore liability for negligence can be imposed, there must first be a legal duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff, and a breach of that duty proximately resulting in the injury. \u2026 It is well established that an owner or possessor of land owes a common law duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors. \u2026 In this case, Westwood did not fail to exercise reasonable care in the use of its land\u2026 The mere fact that Westwood\u2019s facilities used land on both sides of Route 1A\u2026 does not necessarily impose on it the broad duty to provide safe passage\u2026\u201d"

      "support_reasoning": "The case concerns whether a hospital owed a duty to an unrelated police officer to control or detain a sedated adult patient; it does not involve children, after-school programs, or supervision duties in that context. The court explicitly holds that the hospital owed no duty to the third-party officer and rejects expanding special-relationship duties beyond narrow, defined categories. Thus, the opinion does not establish or affirm a duty to exercise reasonable care in supervising children in after-school programs and in fact limits third-party duty theories instead of supporting them.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cWe have not previously recognized, and do not now recognize, a duty to a third person of a medical professional to control a patient (excluding a patient of a mental health professional, see note 10, supra) arising from any claimed special relationship between the medical professional and the patient. \u2026 The hospital owed no duty to Leavitt to control or detain the patient.\u201d"

It does not involve childcare, supervision of children, staffing ratios, or any duty to prevent rough or unsafe play. The proposition about a defendant\u2019s duty in supervising children is unrelated to the contractual and statutory issues decided in this case, so the citation does not support that proposition.",

Jupin v. Kask holds that it was foreseeable that a mentally unstable person with unfettered access to a home with unsecured guns might steal a gun and commit violent crime, and that this supported recognizing a duty; it does not adjudicate causation or foreseeability for \u2018A.J.\u2019s\u2019 injuries, who is not part of this case. Thus the opinion can be cited for the general foreseeability/duty principle, not as authority that A.J.\u2019s injuries in another matter were foreseeable and directly caused by that defendant\u2019s negligence.",

      "support_reasoning": "The proposition concerns factual, causation-and-damages allegations in a routine negligence personal injury claim (concussion, pain and suffering, medical treatment). Payton v. Abbott Labs is a DES class action addressing complex issues of emotional distress without physical harm, wrongful life, prenatal injury, and market-share liability, not the basic standard that a plaintiff may recover for concussion and related damages proximately caused by negligence. The opinion nowhere discusses or establishes a rule about concussions or the specific type of damages described, so it does not support that proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"We note initially that neither the issue of negligence nor that of causation is before us. The certified question assumes both that the defendants were negligent, and that their negligence caused the plaintiffs' emotional distress.... In summary, we hold that a plaintiff in order to recover for negligently inflicted emotional distress must prove the following: (1) negligence; (2) emotional distress; (3) causation; (4) physical harm manifested by objective symptomatology; and (5) that a reasonable person would have suffered emotional distress under the circumstances of the case.\""

Instead, it addresses liability standards under the child trespasser statute, comparative negligence, and procedural issues about amending the complaint. Thus, the case cannot be used as authority for the factual proposition that the plaintiff incurred $5,000 in medical expenses and continues to suffer damages from negligent supervision.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "The jury found that MEC violated its duty toward foreseeable child trespassers under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85Q (1988 ed.). The jury also found that the plaintiff was comparatively negligent. The jury determined that the plaintiff was 75% at fault, while MEC was 25% at fault. Thus, the plaintiff was barred, under the comparative negligence statute, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85 (1988 ed.), from recovering any damages from MEC."
