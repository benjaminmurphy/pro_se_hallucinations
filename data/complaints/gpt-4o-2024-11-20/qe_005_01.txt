**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

6. On or about January 15, 2022, the Plaintiff entered into a rental agreement for the second-floor apartment located at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, Massachusetts, with the Defendant, Michael Anderson, as her landlord. Plaintiff agreed to pay $1,500 per month in rent.  

7. The lease agreement explicitly provides that tenants shall be entitled to quiet enjoyment of the premises, as mandated by Massachusetts law under M.G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

8. Beginning in or around late May or early June 2025, tenants on the third floor of the same building began creating substantial and ongoing disturbances, including:  
   a. Frequent, loud stomping and banging noises during late evening and early morning hours;  
   b. Playing loud music late at night; and  
   c. Frequent movement of furniture, often as late as midnight.  

9. Plaintiff has addressed her concerns directly with the tenants, and while they briefly reduced their noise for a brief period, the disturbances quickly resumed.  

10. Plaintiff repeatedly notified Michael Anderson of these disturbances, making at least five to six complaints between June 2025 and November 2025.  

11. Despite being fully informed, Defendant has refused to take adequate remedial action beyond a single, ineffective conversation with the upstairs tenants. Defendant has stated he “can’t control how people live,” thereby abdicating his legal obligation to preserve the Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment.  

12. As a direct result of Defendant’s failure to act, Plaintiff continues to experience daily disturbances that severely impact her mental and physical health, including:  
   a. Chronic sleep deprivation averaging four to five hours of sleep per night;  
   b. A written warning from her employer for falling asleep at her desk; and  
   c. A need for prescription sleep medication costing $40 per month.  

13. Plaintiff has incurred expenses for earplugs, a white noise machine, and other measures attempting to restore her ability to enjoy her rental unit, all to no avail.  

14. The ongoing disturbances caused by Defendant’s neglect constitute a substantial interference with the Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her rental unit, in direct violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment as codified under M.G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

15. As a result of Defendant's breach of this covenant, Plaintiff has suffered financial harm, emotional distress, diminished quality of life, and physical health challenges for which redress is sought in this Court.

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  

**COUNT I – BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**  

16. Plaintiff restates and incorporates by reference all paragraphs above, as though fully set forth herein.  

17. Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, every residential tenant in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is entitled to the covenant of quiet enjoyment, prohibiting landlords from permitting conduct or conditions that substantially interfere with the tenant's peaceful possession of their rental property.  

18. By failing to address or remediate the ongoing disturbances caused by the third-floor tenants, the Defendant has materially breached this covenant.  

19. Case law establishes that substantial interferences with a tenant’s sleep and peaceful use of their residence violate the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See *AlZiab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997); *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982).  

20. Courts in Massachusetts have held that a landlord’s inaction in the face of known disturbances by other tenants constitutes a breach of M.G.L. c. 186, § 14. See *Lodge v. Bern*, 328 Mass. 42 (1951); *Berman & Sons v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196 (1979).  

21. Defendant’s failure to take effective action concerning Plaintiff's complaints similarly constitutes a violation of Plaintiff’s rights. See *Dartmouth v. Lilley*, 82 Mass. App. Ct. 788 (2012).  

22. Plaintiff has endured demonstrable harm, including financial expenses, emotional distress, and health challenges, as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach.  

23. Under M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover damages for this breach, including statutory damages.
