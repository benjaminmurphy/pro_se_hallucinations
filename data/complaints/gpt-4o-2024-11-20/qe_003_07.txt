### COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
**BOSTON HOUSING COURT**  
______________________________  
**Jessica Reed**,  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**Mark Thompson**,  
Defendant.  
______________________________  

**CIVIL ACTION NO. _______**

**COMPLAINT**  

### I. PARTIES

1. Plaintiff **Jessica Reed** is a resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and resides at 67 Forest Hills Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130.

2. Defendant **Mark Thompson** is the owner and landlord of the residential property located at 67 Forest Hills Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130.

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. The Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, § 3, as this dispute involves the use, condition, or occupancy of residential property and arises under Massachusetts landlord-tenant law.

4. Venue is proper in the Boston Housing Court because the leased premises are located in Jamaica Plain, which falls within the jurisdiction of this Court.

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. On or about February 1, 2023, Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant to rent a studio apartment located at 67 Forest Hills Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, for a monthly rent of $1,600. 

6. During the initial showing of the apartment prior to signing the lease, Plaintiff noticed visible water stains on the ceiling and inquired about the cause of the damage. Defendant assured Plaintiff that the stains were from an old leak that had been repaired.

7. Within the first few months of Plaintiff’s tenancy, during the first substantial rainstorm, water began dripping from the ceiling in the same location with visible stains.

8. Plaintiff immediately informed Defendant of this issue. However, Defendant dismissed the matter, telling Plaintiff it was a "minor cosmetic issue" and characterizing the apartment as having "character."

9. Over time, the water leaks progressively worsened. During a rainstorm on or about October 2023, the leak caused significant damage to the premises, including the destruction of Plaintiff’s property: a couch valued at approximately $900 and a laptop also valued at $900.

10. Plaintiff has repeatedly requested that Defendant repair the ceiling and eliminate the water intrusion. Defendant has refused to take reasonable steps to address the issue.

11. The water intrusion has caused ongoing moisture in the apartment, leading to a pervasive musty smell and conditions that are consistent with mold growth, which Defendant has also failed to remediate. Plaintiff has suffered frequent headaches that she reasonably believes are caused by exposure to these unhealthy conditions.

12. As a result of the persistent leak and resulting conditions, Plaintiff has been unable to fully use the apartment. Plaintiff was forced to move her bed away from the leaking area and is now effectively only able to use half of the apartment.

13. Defendant’s failure to adequately repair the unit and address the ongoing water intrusion violates Plaintiff’s rights under the residential lease agreement, G.L. c. 186, § 14, and Massachusetts common law.

### IV. CAUSES OF ACTION  

**COUNT I: Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  

14. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all prior allegations as if fully set forth herein.  

15. Under Massachusetts law, every lease contains an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14. Landlords who violate a tenant’s right to quiet enjoyment are liable for damages.

16. Defendant breached Plaintiff’s covenant of quiet enjoyment by failing to maintain the apartment in a condition suitable for habitation, by allowing repeated water intrusion, and by refusing to take adequate steps to repair the damage despite Plaintiff’s repeated complaints.

17. Defendant’s actions and omissions substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises. Specifically:
   - Plaintiff incurred financial damages, including the loss of personal property valued at $1,800.
   - Plaintiff has been unable to fully utilize her apartment due to unsafe and unhealthy conditions caused by the leak and mold.
   - Plaintiff has experienced physical discomfort, including frequent headaches and stress arising from Defendant’s refusal to address these unacceptable conditions.

18. A landlord’s failure to address systemic issues that render a rental property unsafe or unsuitable constitutes a violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See *Johnson v. Rabelais*, 201 Mass. App. Ct. 148 (1983) (holding that persistent, unresolved water damage and mold may constitute a breach of quiet enjoyment); see also *Dartmouth v. Goodman*, 78 Mass. App. Ct. 137 (2010) (tenant entitled to damages for landlord’s failure to repair leaks and water damage over a prolonged period).  

19. Plaintiff is entitled to damages as a result of Defendant’s failure to comply with Massachusetts law, including G.L. c. 93A claims for unfair and deceptive practices, which may result from a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment (see *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, 487 Mass. 543 (2022)).  

### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Reed respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and:  

1. Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in the amount of $1,800 to cover the loss of personal property, as well as additional damages for emotional distress and the diminished value of her rental unit caused by Defendant's breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

2. Award Plaintiff statutory damages, including treble damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14, for Defendant’s flagrant and ongoing interference with Plaintiff's quiet enjoyment.

3. Award Plaintiff the costs of this action, including reasonable attorney’s fees, as permitted by G.L. c. 186, § 14 and related Massachusetts statutes.

4. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

### VI. JURY DEMAND  

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,
