---

### **PARTIES AND JURISDICTION**  

1. Plaintiff David Martinez is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Apartment 3B, Lynn, Massachusetts 01901.  

2. Defendant Lynn Apartment Management, Inc. is a Massachusetts corporation with a principal office and registered business operating in Lynn, Massachusetts. Defendant is the property manager and landlord of the apartment building located at 123 Maple Street, Lynn, Massachusetts 01901.  

3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over the claims asserted herein pursuant to M.G.L. c. 218, § 19, as the amount in controversy does not exceed $50,000, and venue is proper in this Court pursuant to M.G.L. c. 223, § 1, because the incident giving rise to this action took place in Lynn, Massachusetts.  

---

### **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

4. Plaintiff resides in a third-floor apartment unit at 123 Maple Street, Lynn, Massachusetts, managed and maintained by Defendant Lynn Apartment Management, Inc.  

5. Defendant, as the landlord and property manager of the premises, is required under M.G.L. c. 148, § 26E and applicable local housing codes to install and maintain working smoke detectors in common areas, including hallways, of the property.  

6. At all relevant times, the smoke detector located in the common hallway outside Plaintiff’s apartment was malfunctioning. Specifically, for several months prior to the incident, the smoke detector emitted an audible "chirping" sound indicative of a low battery.  

7. At an unknown date and time prior to the incident, the smoke detector's battery was removed by an unknown individual and left on the windowsill, rendering the smoke detector non-functional.  

8. Plaintiff personally notified Defendant of the malfunctioning smoke detector at least three times in the months leading up to July 15, 2023. Defendant repeatedly stated that the issue would be addressed but failed to repair or replace the smoke detector.  

9. On or about the evening of July 15, 2023, a fire broke out in the kitchen of a first-floor apartment at 123 Maple Street.  

10. Because the smoke detector in the hallway outside Plaintiff’s unit was not functional, the fire was not promptly detected by individuals on the upper floors of the building, including Plaintiff.  

11. Plaintiff became aware of the fire only after smelling smoke. By that point, the hallway was filled with thick smoke, forcing Plaintiff to evacuate through hazardous conditions.  

12. As a result of exposure to smoke while evacuating, Plaintiff suffered smoke inhalation, difficulty breathing, and related physical injuries.  

13. Plaintiff was treated for smoke inhalation-related injuries, including overnight hospitalization, resulting in approximately $7,000 in medical expenses.  

14. Plaintiff was unable to work for a period of time due to respiratory difficulties, resulting in lost wages of approximately $2,500.  

15. Further, as a result of the fire, Plaintiff's personal belongings sustained significant smoke and water damage.  

16. Defendant's failure to maintain operational smoke detectors in accordance with Massachusetts law was a direct and proximate cause of the injuries and damages sustained by Plaintiff.

### **CAUSE OF ACTION: NEGLIGENCE**

17. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 16 as though fully set forth herein.  

18. Defendant owed a duty of care to maintain a safe residential property and to comply with applicable state and local laws, including ensuring that all common smoke detectors were operational pursuant to M.G.L. c. 148, § 26E and related regulations.  

19. Defendant breached its duty of care by:  
   a. Failing to replace the battery in the malfunctioning hallway smoke detector despite actual and constructive knowledge of its non-functionality;  
   b. Failing to inspect or repair critical safety devices on the premises in a reasonable and timely manner; and  
   c. Failing to ensure the premises complied with Massachusetts fire safety requirements.  

20. Defendant’s breach of its duty of care was a direct and proximate cause of the harm suffered by Plaintiff, including Plaintiff's injuries, hospitalization, lost wages, and property damage.  

21. As a result of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff has incurred damages, including but not limited to:  
   a. Medical expenses of approximately $7,000;  
   b. Lost wages of approximately $2,500;  
   c. Pain and suffering resulting from smoke inhalation and hospitalization; and  
   d. Costs related to damaged personal property.  

22. Massachusetts law imposes civil liability upon a landlord for failing to comply with statutory safety requirements and failing to act reasonably to protect tenants from foreseeable harm. *See Lindsey v. Massios*, 372 Mass. 79, 81 (1977); *Sheehan v. Weaver*, 467 Mass. 734, 742 (2014).  

23. Defendant’s failure to maintain operational smoke detectors was a violation of state regulations and a foreseeable risk to tenant safety, as recognized in *Briggs v. Taylor*, 397 Mass. 1010 (1986) (landlord liability for safety device nonfunctionality).  

24. Defendant knew or should have known the inoperable condition of the hallway smoke detector created a latent hazard, as discussed in *Dos Santos v. Coleta*, 465 Mass. 148, 154-55 (2013).  

25. Defendant's actions and omissions constitute gross violations of standard housing safety codes under *M.G.L. c. 148, § 26E* and its implementing regulations, as recognized in *McAllister v. Boston Housing Auth.*, 429 Mass. 300 (1999).

### **PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff David Martinez respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in his favor and award him the following relief:  

1. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but not less than $9,500, including:  
   a. $7,000 for medical expenses;  
   b. $2,500 for lost wages; and  
   c. Damages for pain, suffering, and property damage.  

2. Prejudgment and post-judgment interest as permitted by law;
