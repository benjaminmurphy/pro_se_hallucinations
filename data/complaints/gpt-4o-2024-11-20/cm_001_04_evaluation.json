While it discusses how relocation can affect each parent\u2019s ability to exercise custodial responsibilities and the children\u2019s relationships with both parents, it does not articulate any general principle that parenting schedules must be structured around a parent\u2019s ability to adequately supervise and care for the children. The focus is on relocation and best interests, not on routine adjustment of parenting schedules to parental caregiving realities.",

Nowhere does the opinion discuss modification standards, or treat a parent\u2019s failure to adequately care for a child during parenting time as grounds to modify an existing custody or parenting-time order. The decision instead addresses allocation of initial custody under a best-interests analysis and the statutory factors concerning primary caregiver and stability.",

The court notes that the judge awarded primary physical custody to the parent more likely to meet the child\u2019s needs and support the other parent\u2019s role, and it describes a detailed visitation schedule designed to give the noncustodial parent meaningful, ongoing contact, conditioned on the child\u2019s welfare.
