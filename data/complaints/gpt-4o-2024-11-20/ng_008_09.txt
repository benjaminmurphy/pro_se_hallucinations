#### **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

5. On September 15, 2023, the Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, was a paying customer at Quincy Bistro, located at 123 Main St, Quincy, MA 02169.  
6. While at the restaurant, a server employed by Quincy Bistro dropped a tray of water glasses in the hallway leading from the kitchen to the dining area.  
7. The server quickly picked up the broken glass but failed to address or adequately clean the water and ice that spilled onto the tile floor.  
8. The Defendant failed to place a wet floor sign or provide any adequate warning of the dangerous condition created by the spill, despite the server’s own acknowledgment that the floor was wet and slippery. The server stated she would “be right back with a mop” but failed to promptly return as promised.  
9. For at least ten minutes following the spill, the hazardous condition remained unapplied and unmarked, despite the server (and other staff members) having actual knowledge of its presence.  
10. When Plaintiff attempted to use the bathroom, she entered the hallway where the spill remained.  
11. Although the Plaintiff saw the floor glistening, it appeared to be due to intrinsic tile shine, not water or ice. In reliance on the Defendant’s failure to warn, the Plaintiff proceeded but slipped on the wet floor, twisting her knee and suffering a serious sprain.  
12. Following the incident, Plaintiff overheard other staff members confirming that they had been “dodging that puddle” for several minutes prior to her fall, further demonstrating both the staff’s knowledge of the hazard and their failure to address it in a reasonable and timely manner.  
13. As a direct and proximate result of the Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered painful injuries, including but not limited to a knee sprain, significant discomfort, and an inability to perform normal activities of daily living for an extended period.  
14. Plaintiff incurred medical expenses in excess of $2,000 for urgent care, medical imaging, a knee brace, and physical therapy.  
15. Plaintiff also suffered lost wages in the approximate amount of $1,500 due to her inability to work as a result of her injury.  
16. The Plaintiff has suffered, and continues to suffer, physical pain, emotional distress, and a diminished quality of life as a direct result of the Defendant’s negligent actions.

#### **CAUSE OF ACTION – NEGLIGENCE**  

17. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 16 as if fully stated herein.  
18. At all relevant times, the Defendant owed a duty of reasonable care to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition for its patrons, including the Plaintiff.  
19. Defendant breached this duty by failing to:  
    a. Adequately clean the water and ice spill in a prompt and reasonable manner;  
    b. Place wet floor signs or otherwise provide warnings of the hazardous condition;  
    c. Train its employees on proper spill-cleaning protocols to prevent unsafe conditions that were foreseeable and preventable; and  
    d. Inspect and monitor the premises to promptly identify and remediate hazardous conditions.  
20. Defendant had actual knowledge of the dangerous condition created by the spill but failed to take reasonable actions to remediate it or warn the Plaintiff of its existence. In the alternative, Defendant had constructive knowledge of the spill by virtue of the time it remained unaddressed and the observations of its employees.  
21. The Defendant’s breach of its duty of care directly and proximately caused the Plaintiff’s injuries, including physical injury, medical expenses, lost income, and pain and suffering.
