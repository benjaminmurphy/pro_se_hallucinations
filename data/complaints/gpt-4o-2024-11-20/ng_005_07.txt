**HAMPDEN COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT**  
**CIVIL ACTION NO.  ________**  

**SARAH THOMPSON,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MARK JOHNSON,**  
Defendant.  

**COMPLAINT**  

**INTRODUCTION**  

1. Plaintiff Sarah Thompson brings this negligence action to recover damages caused by Defendant Mark Johnson’s failure to reasonably secure a tall aluminum extension ladder. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, the ladder fell during high winds and damaged Plaintiff’s vehicle, resulting in property damage and financial loss to Plaintiff.  

**PARTIES**  

2. Plaintiff Sarah Thompson resides at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts 01105.  

3. Defendant Mark Johnson also resides at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts 01105, occupying a portion of the duplex property at that address.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4 because the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000.  

5. Venue is proper in Hampden County pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1 because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Springfield, Massachusetts, which is located in Hampden County.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

6. Plaintiff Sarah Thompson is a lawful tenant and resident of the premises located at 123 Maple Street in Springfield, Massachusetts.  

7. Defendant Mark Johnson is also a lawful tenant and resident of the same premises, occupying a separate unit in the duplex and sharing the driveway and a wooden fence that separates the parking area.  

8. Defendant stores a tall aluminum extension ladder leaning unsecured against the wooden fence adjacent to the parking area Plaintiff uses for her vehicle.  

9. In the months prior to March 15, 2023, Plaintiff expressed concerns to Defendant about the precarious placement of the ladder and warned that it could fall over and cause damage to property, particularly on windy days.  

10. Defendant acknowledged Plaintiff’s concerns and assured her that he would either tie down or reposition the ladder to avoid danger.  

11. Despite his assurances, Defendant failed to take reasonable action to secure the ladder.  

12. On March 15, 2023, while Plaintiff was backing her vehicle into the driveway, strong winds caused the unsecured ladder to fall, striking Plaintiff’s vehicle.  

13. The collapsed ladder dented the hood and shattered the windshield of Plaintiff’s vehicle, causing significant damage.  

14. Plaintiff incurred out-of-pocket expenses to repair the damage, including bodywork and windshield replacement.  

15. Plaintiff also incurred additional financial losses by renting a car for over a week while her vehicle was being repaired.  

16. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered property damage and financial losses.  

**CAUSES OF ACTION**  

**COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE**  

17. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in all preceding paragraphs as if fully stated herein.  

18. In Massachusetts, to prove negligence, the Plaintiff must establish the following elements: (1) the Defendant owed a legal duty to the Plaintiff, (2) the Defendant breached that duty, (3) the breach was the proximate cause of the Plaintiff’s harm, and (4) the Plaintiff sustained damages as a result. *Glidden v. Maglio, 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000)*.  

19. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of reasonable care to secure the ladder he stored in a shared parking area, as a reasonable person would foresee the risk of harm posed by an unsecured ladder in a windy environment. *Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973)*.  

20. Defendant breached his duty by failing to secure the ladder or take reasonable precautions to prevent it from falling, despite being made aware of the potential risks and the Plaintiff’s prior warnings.  

21. The Defendant’s breach was the direct and proximate cause of the damage to Plaintiff’s vehicle. A foreseeable risk materialized when the ladder fell due to strong wind, a condition entirely foreseeable given the manner in which it was stored. See *Cormier v. Lynn, 479 Mass. 35, 37 (2018)* (“A defendant breaches a duty of care when their actions foreseeably cause harm to others”).  

22. Plaintiff has suffered a compensable injury under Massachusetts law in the form of property damage and financial loss. *Glick v. Prince Italian Foods of Saugus, Inc., 25 Mass. App. Ct. 901, 901 (1987)* (recognizing property damage as a compensable harm under negligence law).  

23. Massachusetts common law principles also impose liability for harm caused by an object under one’s control when that harm arises out of a failure to secure the object, as Defendant’s actions demonstrate in this case. *Schlittler v. Dold, 233 Mass. 199, 200-01 (1919).*  

24. Defendant’s inaction violated community safety standards and constitutes negligence for which he is liable. See *Leclerc v. Cote, 406 Mass. 501, 503 (1990)*.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Sarah Thompson demands judgment against Defendant Mark Johnson as follows:  
A. An award of actual damages, including but not limited to the $2,000 paid for repairs, $500 in rental car expenses, and associated financial losses;  
B. Prejudgment interest pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B;  
C. Court costs in this action;  
D. Such other relief as this Court deems proper.  

**JURY DEMAND**  

Pursuant to Rule 38 of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,  
Dated: December 1, 2025
