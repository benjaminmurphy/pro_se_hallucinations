**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**BOSTON MUNICIPAL COURT, DORCHESTER DIVISION**  

**Emily Thompson**,  
Plaintiff  

v.  

**Jordan Smith**,  
Defendant  

**Civil Action No.: [Leave Blank for Court Clerk]**

**COMPLAINT**  

**INTRODUCTION**  
This is a civil action brought under Massachusetts law for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186, §14. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant has acted in violation of their legal duty to provide and maintain habitable premises, resulting in Plaintiff’s deprivation of quiet enjoyment of the rental property located at 12 Maple Street, Dorchester, MA 02124.

**PARTIES**  
1. Plaintiff Emily Thompson is an individual who resides at 12 Maple Street, Apartment #2, Dorchester, MA 02124.  
2. Defendant Jordan Smith is an individual and the landlord of the premises located at 12 Maple Street, Dorchester, MA 02124. Defendant resides at [Defendant's address, to the extent known].

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to M.G.L. c. 218, §19 because the damages sought are within the monetary jurisdiction of this Court, and the property at issue is located within the geographic area of the Dorchester Division of the Boston Municipal Court.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
4. Plaintiff entered into a tenancy agreement with Defendant for the rental property located at 12 Maple Street, Apartment #2, Dorchester, MA, beginning January 1, 2022. Plaintiff’s monthly rent is $1,500.  
5. Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186, §14, Defendant is obligated to ensure that Plaintiff is not unreasonably deprived of quiet enjoyment of the rented premises.  
6. During the winter of 2024-2025, the heating system in Plaintiff’s apartment began to malfunction. Despite cold outdoor temperatures, the heat would intermittently drop to 60 degrees or lower in the evenings for several hours, causing discomfort and hardship for Plaintiff.  
7. Defendant was notified of this issue multiple times and sent repair personnel to address the problem on two occasions. After the first repair, the heat functioned properly for approximately one week before the intermittent failure resumed.  
8. On the second repair attempt, Defendant’s repair contractor reported that the boiler was "old but functional" and did not resolve the issue. As such, the heating problem persisted, and Plaintiff was deprived of consistent heating during the coldest months of the year.  
9. Plaintiff was forced to purchase two space heaters to make the apartment livable. This caused Plaintiff’s electric bills to increase by approximately $150 per month during the winter.  
10. In January 2025, Plaintiff contracted bronchitis that her doctor indicated was exacerbated by exposure to cold indoor air. Plaintiff missed three days of work as a result and incurred additional costs for antibiotics.  
11. Despite Plaintiff’s repeated complaints, Defendant failed to take effective action to provide adequate heat. Defendant continues to assert that the heating system is functional, despite the intermittent and inadequate heating provided.  
12. Defendant’s failure to maintain the rental unit in habitable condition caused Plaintiff both financial and physical harm, in violation of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  
13. Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 12 as if fully set forth herein.  
14. Defendant’s failure to provide consistent and adequate heat constituted a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under M.G.L. c. 186, §14.  
15. Massachusetts law establishes that tenants are entitled to the full and undisturbed use and enjoyment of their rental premises. The covenant of quiet enjoyment includes the right to habitable conditions, which Defendant failed to provide. *See Lindsey v. Normet*, 405 U.S. 56, 91 S.Ct. 862 (1972) (imposing basic habitability standards on landlords); *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, 410 Mass. 855 (1991) (landlords are liable for interference with quiet enjoyment).  
16. Under M.G.L. c. 186, §14, a landlord’s failure to maintain basic services, such as heat, constitutes an unreasonable interference with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment. *See Jablonski v. Casey*, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744 (2005) (inadequate and inconsistent heat deprives tenants of quiet enjoyment).  
17. Defendant’s actions substantially interfered with Plaintiff's ability to enjoy her home, causing financial damage in the form of increased electric bills and medical expenses, as well as significant inconvenience. *See Winchester v. O'Brien*, 266 Mass. 33 (1929).  
18. Defendant acted unreasonably in failing to address the continued issues with the heating system despite knowing the issue persisted. A landlord’s duty extends to maintaining systems necessary for a habitable dwelling. *See Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184 (1973).  

**DAMAGES**  
19. Plaintiff has suffered actual damages in the form of:  
   a. Increased electricity costs totaling $450 over three months;  
   b. Medical expenses related to Plaintiff’s illness, including $75 for antibiotics;  
   c. Lost wages resulting from missed work due to bronchitis;  
   d. Emotional distress and inconvenience caused by substandard living conditions during the winter.  
20. Under M.G.L. c. 186, §14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover three times the amount of her actual damages, plus reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:  
1. An award of actual damages in the amount of $600 for financial losses, tripled to $1,800 pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186, §14;  
2. An award of reasonable costs incurred in bringing this action;  
3. Such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.  

**JURY DEMAND**  
Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all claims so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,
