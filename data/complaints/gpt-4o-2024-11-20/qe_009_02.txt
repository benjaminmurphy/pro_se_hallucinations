**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

6. Plaintiff entered into a written lease agreement with Defendant for the rental of the two-bedroom apartment located at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, MA 01103, commencing on May 1, 2021.  

7. Plaintiff diligently paid the agreed-upon monthly rent of $1,400 throughout the tenancy.

8. As of approximately October 15, 2025, one of the two bedrooms in Plaintiff’s apartment became unusable due to a lack of electricity. The electrical outlets and overhead lighting in that bedroom ceased functioning entirely.

9. Plaintiff immediately notified Defendant of this issue. Defendant sent an electrician to inspect the problem, but neither Defendant nor the electrician made the necessary repairs to restore electricity to the bedroom.

10. The electrician informed Plaintiff and Defendant that the repair would require extensive work to address issues related to the building’s old wiring.

11. Despite assurances from Defendant that the repairs were in progress and that quotes were being obtained, Defendant failed to repair or restore electrical service to the bedroom over the ensuing six weeks.

12. As a result of the defective condition, Plaintiff has been unable to use the bedroom as intended, forcing her to relocate her work activities, which she previously conducted in that room, to off-site locations such as coffee shops. Plaintiff incurred daily expenses averaging $15 for coffee and food, as well as $150 per month for a coworking space membership.

13. Plaintiff’s inability to use the bedroom has diminished the livability of her entire apartment, with furniture and office equipment displaced into the living room area and other spaces, creating substantial inconvenience and disruption of her daily life.

14. Defendant’s failure to repair the deficient condition constitutes a violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment implied in all residential leases under Massachusetts law.

15. Defendant’s actions and omissions interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises, causing Plaintiff to suffer monetary damages, emotional distress, inconvenience, and disruption.

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  
(M.G.L. c. 186, § 14)

16. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 15 as if fully set forth herein.

17. Under Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, § 14, a landlord’s deliberate or negligent failure to remedy conditions that substantially interfere with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of leased premises constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, entitling the tenant to recover compensatory damages.  

18. The condition of Plaintiff’s bedroom, which is uninhabitable due to the lack of electricity, constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises.

19. Defendant has had reasonable notice of the defective condition and the opportunity to repair the issue but has failed to do so in a timely or reasonable manner.

20. Defendant’s failure to address the defective condition has caused foreseeable damages to Plaintiff, including direct financial loss, emotional distress, and inconvenience.  

21. Plaintiff is entitled to recover damages for Defendant’s violation of her right to quiet enjoyment pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186, § 14 and related case law, including Dartmouth v. Silva, 325 Mass. 401 (1950), which holds that tenants are entitled to the uninterrupted enjoyment of their premises.

22. Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is also entitled to recover attorney’s fees and court costs, even though she is self-represented in this matter.
