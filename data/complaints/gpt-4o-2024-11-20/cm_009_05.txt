**Jessica Lane,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**Mark Lane,**  
Defendant.  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**

**NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Lane, in the above-captioned matter, and hereby files this **Complaint for Modification of Custody Order** pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, and other applicable statutes, seeking modification of the custody and parenting time order dated May 15, 2019. Plaintiff respectfully submits that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior order, necessitating a modification in the best interests of Sophia Lane. In support of this Complaint, Plaintiff states as follows:**

---

### 1. **PARTIES**
1.1 Plaintiff, Jessica Lane, resides at [Redacted Address] in [Town], Massachusetts, and is the custodial parent of the minor child, Sophia Lane, age 8. Plaintiff has complied with all court orders and parenting time arrangements in the original custody order entered on May 15, 2019.  
   
1.2 Defendant, Mark Lane, resides at [Redacted Address] in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Defendant is the non-custodial parent of the minor child and is entitled to parenting time as directed by the 2019 custody order.

---

### 2. **CHILDREN SUBJECT TO THE PROCEEDING**
2.1 This litigation involves one minor child: Sophia Lane, born on [Child’s Date of Birth], currently age 8.  

---

### 3. **JURISDICTION**
3.1 This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28A, as Plaintiff and Defendant are the parents of the minor child and Massachusetts is the home state of the minor child.  

3.2 Venue in Barnstable Probate and Family Court is proper pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1, as the Defendant resides in Barnstable County.

---

### 4. **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS SUPPORTING MODIFICATION**
4.1 On May 15, 2019, this Court entered a custody order granting Plaintiff primary physical custody of the minor child, with Defendant entitled to parenting time every other weekend and one midweek overnight on Wednesdays. At the time of the order, both parents resided in [Town], Massachusetts, and the child attended [Name of Local School].  

4.2 Since the entry of the custody order, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances. Specifically:  

   a. Defendant has moved approximately ninety (90) miles away to Cape Cod, Massachusetts.  

   b. Defendant continues to exercise the midweek overnight on Wednesdays despite this significant distance, which requires transporting the minor child over ninety miles to Cape Cod after school on Wednesday, and then returning her to school in [Original Town] on Thursday morning.  

   c. Defendant’s transportation of the child during the midweek overnight necessitates waking her as early as 4:30 AM on Thursday mornings, which has resulted in significant stress, sleep deprivation, and fatigue for the child.  

   d. The child’s teacher, [Teacher’s Name], has expressed concerns over the child’s participation and engagement in school on Thursdays due to her exhaustion.  

   e. Defendant’s relocation and the long commute from Cape Cod to [Town], Massachusetts, constitute a substantial change of circumstances not contemplated in the original 2019 custody order.  

4.3 The continuation of this midweek overnight arrangement is no longer in the best interests of Sophia Lane. It causes the child unnecessary hardship, disrupts her educational performance, and adversely affects her health and well-being.  

4.4 Plaintiff seeks modification of the parenting schedule to eliminate the midweek overnight on Wednesdays and make any appropriate adjustments to the weekend parenting time schedule, in furtherance of the child’s best interests.

---

### 5. **REQUEST FOR MODIFICATION**
5.1 Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the existing custody order dated May 15, 2019, as follows:  

   a. Eliminate Defendant’s midweek overnight parenting time on Wednesdays.  

   b. Adjust the weekend parenting time schedule as necessary to accommodate any changes resulting from the elimination of the midweek overnight.  

   c. Any other relief this Honorable Court deems just and proper.  

---

### 6. **RELEVANT STATUTES AND CASE LAW**  
6.1 Pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, the Court may modify a custody or parenting time order upon a showing of "a material and substantial change in circumstances" and consideration of the child's best interests.  

6.2 The best interests of the child are paramount in custody determinations. See **Custody of Zia, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 237, 239 (2000)**; **Braiman v. Braiman, 378 Mass. 86, 88 (1979)**.  

6.3 A material change in a parent’s living situation (e.g., relocation) combined with negative impacts on the child may warrant modification of custody orders. See **Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 402 (1981)**; **Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 261 (2001)**.  

6.4 Sleep deprivation, academic struggles, and stress caused by a custody arrangement are valid considerations in determining the child's best interests. See **Pizzino v. Miller, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865, 870 (2006)**.  

6.5 Courts must consider the practical feasibility of custody arrangements, particularly long commutes that interfere with the child’s school performance or wellbeing. See **Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 844 (2003)**; **Hunter v. Rose, 463 Mass. 488, 495-96 (2012)**.  

6.6 Parenting schedules that disrupt sleep or school performance are contrary to the child’s best interests. See **Woodside v. Woodside, 79 Mass. App. Ct. 713, 719 (2011)**.  

6.7 Massachusetts courts generally reconsider midweek parenting time when it imposes undue burdens based on a parental relocation. See **Carr v. Carr, 44 Mass. App. Ct. 882, 883 (1999)**.

### 7. **PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Find that there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances since the entry of the May 15, 2019 custody order;  
2. Modify the parenting time schedule to eliminate Defendant’s midweek overnight on Wednesdays;  
3. Adjust the weekend parenting schedule as appropriate;  
4. Grant any other relief this Court deems just and equitable.
