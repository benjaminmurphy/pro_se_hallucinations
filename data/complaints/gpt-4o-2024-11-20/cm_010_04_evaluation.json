However, it does not state or clearly imply that a \"strong bond between a child and each parent\" is a factor to be weighed heavily; rather, it focuses on the custodial parent\u2013child family unit and alternative visitation patterns. The proposition overstates and reframes the case\u2019s reasoning about visitation and custodial well-being.",

Felton, 383 Mass. at 234, quoting from Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 4600 (West 1981 Supp.), and entered his judgment prohibiting removal on the basis that the move would make visitation more difficult. We consider that factor not in itself conclusive. The best interests of children for purposes of deciding whether to permit removal are also interwoven with the well being of the custodial parent, and the determination, therefore, requires that the interests of the mother also be taken into account."
