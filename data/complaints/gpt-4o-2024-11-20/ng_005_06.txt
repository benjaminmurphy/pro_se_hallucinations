### FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5. Plaintiff resides at a duplex located at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, Massachusetts, where she shares a common driveway with Defendant.

6. Defendant owns and regularly uses a tall aluminum extension ladder, which he has kept leaning unsecured against the wooden fence adjacent to the shared driveway.

7. On several occasions prior to March 15, 2023, Plaintiff expressed concerns to Defendant that the unsecured ladder was a hazard and could fall, causing damage to Plaintiff’s property.

8. Despite Plaintiff’s warnings, Defendant assured her that he would either secure the ladder or store it elsewhere, but failed to take any corrective action.

9. On or about March 15, 2023, Plaintiff was backing into her parking space in the shared driveway when a gust of wind caused Defendant’s ladder to fall and crash onto the hood and windshield of Plaintiff’s car.

10. The ladder dented the hood of Plaintiff’s car and cracked the windshield, rendering the vehicle temporarily undriveable until repairs could be completed.

11. As a result of the incident, Plaintiff incurred the following expenses:
   a. A deductible for repairing the hood and windshield of her car;  
   b. The cost of renting a car for approximately one week while her car was being repaired.

12. Plaintiff’s damages were directly and proximately caused by Defendant’s negligent failure to secure the ladder against foreseeable risks posed by wind or other external forces.

### COUNT I: NEGLIGENCE

13. Plaintiff incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 12 as if fully set forth herein.  

14. Under Massachusetts law, Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of reasonable care as Plaintiff’s neighbor and co-tenant at the same property (see Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693 (1973)). Defendant’s duty extended to ensuring that no dangerous conditions created by his property or conduct posed a foreseeable risk of harm to Plaintiff or her belongings.

15. Defendant breached this duty by failing to adequately secure the tall aluminum extension ladder despite Plaintiff’s repeated warnings regarding its hazardous condition.

16. Defendant knew or reasonably should have known that failing to secure the ladder created a substantial risk that it might fall and cause injury or property damage (see Cimino v. Milford Keg, Inc., 385 Mass. 323, 330 (1982)).

17. Defendant’s breach of duty was the proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages. The harm suffered by Plaintiff, including damage to her car and associated expenses, was a foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s negligence (see Polak v. Whitney, 21 Mass. App. Ct. 349, 350-51 (1985)).

### DAMAGES

18. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered the following damages:
   a. Expenses for repairing the damaged hood and windshield of her car;  
   b. Additional costs for renting a replacement vehicle during the repair period.

19. Plaintiff seeks compensation for her economic damages in an amount to be determined at trial. The amount exceeds the jurisdictional threshold of $50,000.

20. Defendant’s negligent conduct was wanton and reckless in disregard of Plaintiff’s rights, justifying the imposition of compensatory damages.

---

### PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jennifer Lee respectfully requests judgment against Defendant Mark Thompson as follows:

1. An award of monetary damages in an amount to be determined at trial, including:
   a. Costs of repairing Plaintiff’s vehicle;  
   b. The costs of renting a temporary replacement vehicle;  
   c. Any other incidental or consequential damages.  

2. Pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;

3. Costs of this action, including reasonable attorney’s fees if applicable; and

4. Any further relief the Court deems just and proper.

---

### JURY DEMAND

The Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable pursuant to Rule 38 of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure.
