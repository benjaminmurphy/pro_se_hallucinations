**CIVIL ACTION NO. [To be Assigned by Clerk]**  

**JESSICA TAYLOR,**  
Plaintiff,  
v.  
**EMILY RODRIGUEZ,**  
Defendant.  

**COMPLAINT**

**PARTIES AND JURISDICTION**  

1. Plaintiff, Jessica Taylor, is an individual residing in Worcester County, Massachusetts.  

2. Defendant, Emily Rodriguez, is an individual residing in Worcester County, Massachusetts, and is the owner and landlord of a certain three-unit residential property located at 123 Maple St., Worcester, MA 01603 (the "Property").  

3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 218, § 19 given that the claimed damages fall within the jurisdictional limits of the District Court.  

4. Venue is proper in this district pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223, § 1, as the events giving rise to this Complaint occurred in Worcester County.

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

5. On February 10, 2023, Plaintiff Jessica Taylor was delivering groceries to a tenant who resides at the Property.  

6. The Defendant, Emily Rodriguez, as the owner of the Property, has a duty to maintain the sidewalk adjoining the Property in a reasonably safe condition for lawful visitors and members of the public, including tenants, guests, and delivery personnel, pursuant to Massachusetts common law and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 85, § 5.  

7. On or about February 7, 2023, a significant snowstorm occurred in Worcester, Massachusetts.  

8. Following the snowstorm, Defendant shoveled only a narrow path down the center of the sidewalk adjoining the Property but failed to apply salt, sand, or any other ice mitigation measures to prevent the formation of ice.  

9. Over the course of the next several days, the uncleared portions of the sidewalk melted during the daytime hours and refroze at night, resulting in a thick sheet of ice on the shoveled pathway.  

10. Tenants of the Property notified Defendant of the dangerous icy condition on the sidewalk, including by sending her text messages and photographs, but Defendant responded by stating, “the sun will take care of it.”  

11. Despite prior notice of the hazard, Defendant failed to take any further action to address the icy condition on the sidewalk.  

12. On February 10, 2023, at approximately 3:00 p.m., Plaintiff Jessica Taylor was walking up the sidewalk adjoining the Property when she stepped onto the ice-covered pathway shoveled by Defendant.  

13. Plaintiff's feet slipped out from under her, and she fell forcefully onto her back, landing on the icy sidewalk.  

14. As a result of the fall, Plaintiff sustained injuries, including but not limited to a lower back injury.  

15. Plaintiff subsequently sought medical treatment for her injuries, incurring approximately $2,500 in medical expenses.  

16. Due to her injuries, Plaintiff was unable to work for approximately one week and suffered lost wages in the amount of $800.  

17. The hazardous condition of the sidewalk was a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION – NEGLIGENCE**  

18. Plaintiff restates and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1 through 17 as if fully set forth herein.  

19. Defendant Emily Rodriguez owed a duty of reasonable care to Plaintiff and all other lawful visitors to the Property to maintain the sidewalk adjoining the Property in a reasonably safe condition, free from hazards such as ice, pursuant to Massachusetts common law, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 85, § 5, and applicable municipal ordinances in Worcester, Massachusetts.  

20. Defendant breached this duty by failing to adequately clear the sidewalk, failing to apply salt or sand, and failing to remediate or warn of the known icy condition despite receiving notice of the hazard from tenants.  

21. Defendant's conduct was negligent in that it created an unreasonably dangerous condition on the sidewalk, which Defendant knew or should have known posed a risk of harm to lawful visitors such as Plaintiff.  

22. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff slipped on the icy sidewalk and sustained serious injuries, as set forth above.  

23. Defendant’s acts and omissions constitute negligence under Massachusetts law, as established in *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368 (2010) (holding property owners owe a duty to lawful visitors to remedy hazards caused by snow and ice accumulation); *Osornio v. Reardon*, 62 Mass. App. Ct. 115 (2004) (confirming liability for injury caused by failure to address icy conditions on property).  

24. Defendant’s failure to properly maintain the sidewalk and respond to complaints of hazardous conditions demonstrates a breach of the standard of care outlined in Massachusetts case law, including *Klerman v. Fine*, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 1003 (2000) and *Barry v. Beverly Enterprises-Massachusetts, Inc.*, 418 Mass. 590 (1994).  

25. Massachusetts statutory and case law further support Plaintiff’s claim, including Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 242, § 1 (liability for maintaining unreasonable hazards on property) and *Sylvia v. Belmont Springs, Inc.*, 414 Mass. 60 (1992).  

26. Plaintiff's injuries and damages would not have occurred but for Defendant's negligent failure to properly address and remediate the icy condition on the sidewalk adjoining the Property.  

**DAMAGES**  

27. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered the following damages:  
   a. Medical expenses in the amount of $2,500;  
   b. Lost wages in the amount of $800; and  
   c. Pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life in an amount to be determined by the trier of fact.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Taylor respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and award the following relief:  

1. Compensatory damages in an amount to fully and fairly compensate Plaintiff for her injuries and losses, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering;  

2. Interest and costs, as provided by law;  

3. Attorneys’ fees, if applicable, as allowed by law; and  

4. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

Respectfully submitted,
