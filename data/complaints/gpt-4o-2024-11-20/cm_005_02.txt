**Jessica Thompson,**  
Plaintiff,  
v.  
**Kyle Miller,**  
Defendant.  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CHILD CUSTODY**  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws c. 208, § 28 and other applicable statutes, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody and parenting time order entered by this Court on May 15, 2022. In support of her Complaint, Plaintiff states as follows:

---

### I. PARTIES  

1. **Plaintiff:** Jessica Thompson resides at [Plaintiff’s Address] (address omitted for privacy purposes but on record with the Court), in Bristol County, Massachusetts. She is the mother of the minor children, Emma Thompson and Noah Thompson.  

2. **Defendant:** Kyle Miller resides at [Defendant’s Address], also in Bristol County, Massachusetts. He is the father of the minor children.  

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE  

3. The Bristol County Probate and Family Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, as this Court entered the original Judgment of Custody on May 15, 2022, and jurisdiction over the parties and the minor children continues under applicable law.  

4. Venue is appropriate under G.L. c. 209B, § 2, as both parents and the children reside within Bristol County, Massachusetts.  

---

### III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND  

5. On May 15, 2022, this Court issued a custody order granting the parties joint legal custody of the minor children, Emma Thompson (born [DOB]) and Noah Thompson (born [DOB]). The order also provided that the children would primarily reside with Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, with regular parenting time for Defendant, Kyle Miller, every other weekend.  

6. The original order specifies that both parties must support the relationship of the children with the other parent and prohibits either party from making disparaging remarks about the other parent in the presence of the children.  

7. Since the issuance of the original order, a substantial and material change in circumstances has arisen that warrants a modification of the custody arrangement to serve the best interests of the minor children, pursuant to Dupre v. Dupre, 464 Mass. 198 (2013), and Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996).  

---

### IV. MATERIAL CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES  

8. Over the past year, Defendant has repeatedly enrolled the minor children in extracurricular activities that conflict with Plaintiff’s regular parenting time, without consulting Plaintiff or obtaining her agreement, in violation of the spirit of joint legal custody as defined in Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).  

9. On multiple occasions, Defendant has told the minor children that it is Plaintiff’s "fault" if they are unable to attend these activities while in Plaintiff’s care. This behavior undermines Plaintiff’s relationship with the children and constitutes a violation of the existing order prohibiting disparagement, as addressed in Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).  

10. Plaintiff has learned from the children that Defendant has directly disparaged her in their presence, calling her "selfish" and alleging that she "doesn't really love them" when disagreements over scheduling arise. Such statements are harmful to the emotional and psychological well-being of the children and directly violate the existing order and the principle in Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010).  

11. One of the minor children, Noah, has begun experiencing consistent stomach aches on transition days between Plaintiff’s home and Defendant’s home, which Plaintiff believes may result from the stress caused by the ongoing conflict and disparagement, as contemplated in Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).  

12. The current custody arrangement and lack of clarity regarding joint decision-making have led to significant conflicts, which negatively affect the children’s emotional stability and well-being. Such conflicts are sufficient to constitute a material change in circumstances under Ardizoni, 40 Mass. App. Ct. at 736.  

---

### V. RELIEF REQUESTED  

13. Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the existing custody order to award her sole legal custody of the minor children, as such a modification is necessary to protect their best interests and ensure their emotional stability, as set forth in G.L. c. 208, § 31 and Mass. Sup. Jud. Ct. Rule 1:28 regarding child-focused adjudications.  

14. Plaintiff further requests that this Court clarify the parenting time schedule to ensure that extracurricular activities are discussed and agreed upon by both parents before enrollment, consistent with Hunter v. Rose, 463 Mass. 488 (2012).  

15. Plaintiff specifically requests that the Court include provisions prohibiting disparaging remarks about either parent in the children’s presence, and that all communication between the parties regarding parenting matters be conducted through a parenting coordinator or a monitored platform, as authorized in Ginsburg v. Ginsburg, 429 Mass. 594 (1999).  

16. Plaintiff asks this Honorable Court to find that awarding her sole legal custody, combined with primary physical custody, better serves the children’s best interests in light of the harmful impacts of Defendant's conduct, as guided by Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).  

---

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Modify the existing child custody order entered on May 15, 2022, to award Plaintiff sole legal custody of the minor children;  
2. Clarify and modify the parenting schedule to prevent unilateral scheduling of activities by Defendant that interfere with Plaintiff’s designated parenting time;  
3. Order Defendant to cease disparaging Plaintiff in the presence of the children;  
4. Require all parenting-related communication to occur through a neutral parenting coordinator or a court-monitored platform;  
5. Award Plaintiff any other and further relief that this Court deems just and proper.
