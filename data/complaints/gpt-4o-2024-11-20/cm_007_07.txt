**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**BRISTOL COUNTY PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT**  

**DOCKET NO. ____________**  

**LAURA CHESTER,**  
Plaintiff,  
v.  
**MICHAEL CHESTER,**  
Defendant.  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY**  

**Introduction**  
The Plaintiff, Laura Chester, respectfully submits this Complaint for Modification of the judgment dated April 15, 2018, which established a 50/50 physical custody arrangement for the minor child, Samantha Chester. There has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the original custody order, such that modification is in the best interest of the child.  

**Parties**  
1. Plaintiff **Laura Chester** resides at [your address], in Bristol County, Massachusetts.  
2. Defendant **Michael Chester** resides at [insert address], in Bristol County, Massachusetts.  

**Jurisdiction and Venue**  
3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 209C, § 20 and G.L. c. 208, § 28. Venue is proper in the Probate and Family Court for Bristol County as the parties reside in this county, and this is the Court that issued the original custody order.  

**Factual Allegations**  
4. Plaintiff and Defendant are the biological parents of **Samantha Chester**, who is twelve (12) years old, born on [insert DOB].  
5. On April 15, 2018, this Court issued a judgment granting Plaintiff and Defendant shared legal and physical custody of Samantha, with a weekly 50/50 parenting schedule.  
6. At the time the original order was entered, both parents resided near one another and were in good physical health, which facilitated the shared arrangement and provided continuity and stability for Samantha.  
7. There has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the judgment, specifically:  
   a. The Defendant, Michael Chester, was recently diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition that significantly impairs mobility and physical functioning.  
   b. As part of this condition, Defendant has experienced multiple falls while at home and now relies on a wheelchair for daily mobility.  
   c. Defendant’s physician has advised that Defendant should not be alone with the minor child in environments involving stairs or situations requiring quick physical responses, as this poses safety risks for both Defendant and the child.  
   d. Defendant has continued to assert his ability to maintain the 50/50 physical custody arrangement despite his declining physical health, resulting in situations where Samantha is placed in unsafe environments and is at times relied on by Defendant to perform caretaking duties inappropriate for a child of her age, such as assisting Defendant in transferring from a wheelchair to a bed and carrying out other household tasks.  
8. Samantha has expressed concerns about being placed in situations where safety can be compromised and is experiencing emotional stress stemming from the current custodial arrangement.  
9. Samantha’s best interests would be served by modifying the existing arrangement to provide the Plaintiff with primary physical custody while ensuring the Defendant continues to play a meaningful and appropriate role in Samantha’s life in accordance with his physical abilities.  

**Legal Standard for Custody Modification**  
10. Under Massachusetts law, this Court has the authority to modify a prior custody judgment upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and where modification is in the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; **Hunter v. Rose**, 463 Mass. 488, 494 (2012).  
11. A material change in circumstances can include the physical or mental health of a parent that impacts their ability to ensure the child’s welfare. See **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177, 183-84 (2006).  
12. The Court must prioritize the best interests of the child, which includes considering the child’s safety, emotional well-being, and need for stability and continuity. See **Custody of Calyre**, 433 Mass. 55, 66-67 (2000); **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704, 711 (1985).  
13. The Defendant’s progressive neurological condition renders him unable to safely manage a 50/50 physical custody arrangement, creating a material and substantial change in circumstances meeting the threshold for modification under Massachusetts law. See **Callahan v. Callahan**, 85 Mass. App. Ct. 369, 376 (2014); **Hughes v. McGrath**, 94 Mass. App. Ct. 221, 224 (2018).  
14. Additionally, the current arrangement impermissibly places Samantha in circumstances where her safety and well-being are compromised, necessitating a modification of custody for her best interests, consistent with **Pettinella v. Pettinella**, 41 Mass. App. Ct. 276 (1996) and **Schechter v. Schechter**, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239, 245 (2015).  

**Relief Requested**  
WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Laura Chester, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  
1. Determine that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the judgment dated April 15, 2018;  
2. Modify the existing custody order to grant Plaintiff primary physical custody of the minor child, Samantha Chester, with appropriate parenting time for the Defendant tailored to his physical limitations and capacities;  
3. Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper in the best interests of the child.  

Respectfully submitted,  
Laura Chester, Plaintiff
