v.  

**Lisa Thompson,**  
__Defendant.__  
__________________________________  

**CIVIL ACTION NO. ______**  

**COMPLAINT**  

**INTRODUCTION**  

1. This is an action brought under Massachusetts law seeking damages arising out of Defendant Lisa Thompson’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts General Laws (“G.L.”) c. 186, § 14. Specifically, the Defendant’s failure to address substantial water intrusion and related habitability issues in Plaintiff Maya Johnson’s rental unit at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts, has deprived Plaintiff of the quiet use and enjoyment of her home. Defendant’s retaliatory conduct following Plaintiff’s exercise of her legal rights further exacerbates this unlawful behavior.  

**PARTIES**  

2. Plaintiff Maya Johnson is a tenant residing at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts, which she has rented from Defendant since March 1, 2022.  

3. Defendant Lisa Thompson is the owner and landlord of 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to the Court’s general jurisdiction under Massachusetts law.  

5. Venue is proper in the Boston Housing Court because the events giving rise to this claim occurred at a residential property located within its jurisdiction.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

6. Plaintiff rents a basement unit located at 123 Maple Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts, from Defendant at a monthly rent of $1,200.  

7. On or about November 2025, the Plaintiff noticed water seepage through the basement wall of her unit, particularly during periods of heavy rain.  

8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the water problem by text message and requested that Defendant address the issue.  

9. Defendant responded that she would “look into it,” but Defendant failed to take any steps to repair the water intrusion.  

10. The water intrusion continued unabated, causing damage to Plaintiff’s personal property, including a rug and a wooden bookshelf, valued at approximately $400.  

11. Plaintiff has also been forced to run a dehumidifier constantly to mitigate the water problem, resulting in increased electricity costs.  

12. Frustrated by Defendant’s inaction, Plaintiff reported the water intrusion to the appropriate housing authority.  

13. Upon inspection, city officials confirmed the presence of the water intrusion problem as well as other housing code violations at the property.  

14. Defendant became aware of the inspection and, shortly thereafter, informed Plaintiff that she would not renew Plaintiff’s lease when it expires in March 2026.  

15. Defendant claimed that this decision was due to Plaintiff’s late rent payment in October 2025. However, the true motive for Defendant’s decision appears to be retaliation for Plaintiff reporting the code violations.  

16. As of the filing of this complaint, Defendant has not repaired the water intrusion problem despite being aware of its impact on Plaintiff’s ability to enjoy her home.  

17. Defendant’s conduct constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, as codified under G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

18. Plaintiff has suffered significant harm, including property damage, increased utility costs, and emotional distress, as a result of Defendant’s conduct.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  

**BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT (G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  

19. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through 18 as if fully set forth herein.  

20. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, every residential lease in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, which protects tenants from serious interference with their use and enjoyment of the leased premises.  

21. Defendant’s failure to address the persistent water intrusion in Plaintiff’s unit constitutes a violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment because it materially interferes with Plaintiff’s ability to occupy her home in a habitable condition.  

22. Defendant’s retaliatory conduct in response to Plaintiff’s exercise of her rights under Massachusetts law further constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  

23. Defendant’s conduct has caused Plaintiff to suffer actual damages, including property damage, increased utility costs, diminished quality of life, and emotional distress, all in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

24. Plaintiff is entitled to damages, including up to three times her actual damages and attorney’s fees, under G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Maya Johnson respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grant the following relief:  

1. Award Plaintiff actual damages in the amount of $400 for property damage, plus additional damages for increased utility costs and emotional distress.  

2. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, treble Plaintiff’s actual damages.  

3. Award Plaintiff reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of litigation as provided by G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

4. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.  

**SIGNATURE**  

Respectfully submitted this 1st day of December 2025.
