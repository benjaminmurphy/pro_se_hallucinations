      "support_reasoning": "Yannas does apply a \u2018best interests of the child\u2019 framework, but it is specifically in the context of removal/relocation by a custodial parent, not a general modification-of-custody standard nor an articulated requirement to prioritize \u201csafety and welfare\u201d in all custody matters. The opinion focuses on balancing the custodial parent\u2019s \u2018real advantage\u2019 in relocating with the child\u2019s best interests and the noncustodial parent\u2019s visitation rights, not on modifying custody or emphasizing child safety as a distinct controlling factor.

Hale, supra at 815), and thus the central question in this case is how these \u2018best interests\u2019 are to be determined.\u2026 An evaluation of the best interests of the child requires attention to whether the quality of the child\u2019s life may be improved by the change\u2026 and the extent to which moving or not moving will affect the emotional, physical, or developmental needs of the child.\u201d"

However, Kali is not a relocation/removal case and does not apply or elaborate the specific Yannas standard; instead, it interprets G.L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10(a) and emphasizes stability and continuity with a satisfactory caregiver, not a generic mandate to \u2018prioritize safety and welfare in all custody matters.\u2019 Thus, relying on Kali as direct authority for the Yannas removal standard or as a broad safety-first rule overstates its holding.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe \u2018best interests of the child\u2019 standard appeared in our case law at least as early as 1865\u2026 It has been adhered to ever since. See, e.g., Blixt v.

Because the case neither discusses nor establishes rules for custody modification based on a parent\u2019s inability to provide a safe and stable environment, it does not support the claimed proposition.",

The court repeatedly emphasizes that the mother is an \"unquestionably fit\" parent and focuses on statutory interpretation and relocation standards, not on unfitness or instability as grounds for modifying custody. Thus, it does not establish or affirm the proposition that parental inability to provide a safe, stable environment linked to substance abuse justifies custody modification.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"There was no question that the mother, who retained sole physical custody of the child, was a fit, indeed a good, parent. ... Once it was established that the mother had relocated prior to an adjudication of paternity, the judge had no grounds to examine the reasons for or sincerity of the mother\u2019s move. After paternity was established, the judge was obligated to take as a given that the mother and the child resided 400 miles apart... and to fashion custody and visitation orders pursuant to the three factors set out in G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 (a).\""
