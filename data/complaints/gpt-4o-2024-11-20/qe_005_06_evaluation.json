In discussing the common-law covenant that \u00a7 14 builds on, the court emphasizes interference with the tenant\u2019s rights, not mere technical breaches, which aligns with the modern formulation of protection against \u201csubstantial interference.\u201d Although the exact phrase \u201csubstantial interference\u201d is not used, the court\u2019s description and citations (e.g., Winchester v. O\u2019Brien, Blackett v. Olanoff) support that standard.",

It does not explicitly restate the \u201csubstantial interference\u201d formulation, but it relies on and applies prior quiet-enjoyment cases (including Simon) that define breaches in terms of significant interference with tenancy. Thus, while indirect, the case is consistent with and supportive of the substantial-interference conception of the covenant, though it is not the clearest source for that specific phrasing.",

St. 1927, c. 339, \u00a7 1. See Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 101-102 (1982). At common law, and as originally enacted by statute, the covenant of quiet enjoyment prohibited a landlord from wilful or intentional interference with a tenant\u2019s quiet enjoyment of the leased premises\u2026. Today we make clear what was implicit in those rulings: to support the imposition of liability under the quiet enjoyment statute, there must be a showing of at least negligent conduct by a landlord\u2026.\u201d}"

The court does not discuss noise alone as a basis for substantial interference, nor does it hold that noise by itself constitutes a substantial interference in violation of the covenant. Thus this case does not directly support the specific proposition that noise, as such, may constitute a substantial interference sufficient to violate the covenant of quiet enjoyment.",

Instead, the court expressly says the landlords did not intend to create the conditions, notes they made some attempts to remedy the problem, and grounds liability in the natural and probable consequences of what they did, failed to do, or permitted, regardless of intent.

The emotional distress and diminution in value damages are tied specifically to statutory consumer protection and warranty-of-habitability claims, not to a generic rule that a plaintiff in any breach case may recover actual damages including emotional distress and financial harm. Thus it does not squarely support the broad proposition stated.",
