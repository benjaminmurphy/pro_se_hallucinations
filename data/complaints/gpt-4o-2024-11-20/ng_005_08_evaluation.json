Leavitt does discuss proximate cause in terms of foreseeability, but it ultimately holds that the plaintiff\u2019s injury was *not* within the scope of foreseeable risk and thus that proximate cause was lacking. The case therefore does not support a claim that proximate cause exists in the ladder scenario; at most it provides a general foreseeability standard, which in Leavitt cut against finding proximate cause.",
