v.                                                    **Civil Action No.: ___________**

**COMPLAINT**  

**INTRODUCTION**  

1. This is a negligence action filed under Massachusetts common law arising out of severe injuries sustained by Plaintiff Ethan Johnson’s minor son, [Minor’s Name], while under the care and supervision of an after-school program operated by Defendant Brockton Community Center.  

2. Due to Defendant’s breach of its duty to provide adequate supervision, Plaintiff’s minor son was injured, requiring medical treatment for a concussion, resulting in economic losses and undue suffering. Plaintiff seeks damages to compensate for these losses and harm.  

**PARTIES**  

3. Plaintiff Ethan Johnson is an individual residing in Brockton, Massachusetts. Plaintiff brings this action in his individual capacity and as the parent and next friend of his minor child [Minor’s Name].  

4. Defendant Brockton Community Center is a nonprofit organization or other entity domiciled at 123 Main Street, Brockton, Massachusetts, and operates an after-school program for minors, among other activities.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

5. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to M.G.L. c. 212, § 4 because the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs.  

6. Venue is proper in this Court under M.G.L. c. 223, § 1, as the events giving rise to this claim occurred in Brockton, Massachusetts, which is located in Bristol County.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

7. Defendant Brockton Community Center operates an after-school program located at 123 Main Street, Brockton, Massachusetts, and advertises that children will be “supervised at all times” during program hours.  

8. On or about September 15, 2023, Plaintiff’s minor son, [Minor’s Name], aged eight years old, attended Defendant’s after-school program.  

9. On the date in question, twenty children were in the gymnasium under the purported supervision of two staff members employed by Defendant.  

10. Contrary to Defendant’s advertised assurances, one of the supervising staff members left the gymnasium to perform paperwork elsewhere, leaving only one staff member to supervise twenty children.  

11. The staff member who remained in the gymnasium failed to adequately monitor the children and instead spent significant time looking at their phone while near the bleachers.  

12. During this time, two older boys, approximately twelve years old, began playing an unsanctioned, violent tackle game, colliding with each other and others on the hardwood floor.  

13. When complaints were raised to the staff member about the unsafe behavior, the staff member dismissed the concerns, responding, “boys will be boys.”  

14. During the unrestrained game, one of the older boys tackled Plaintiff’s eight-year-old son with great force, causing him to hit his head on the hardwood floor.  

15. Plaintiff’s son lost consciousness for approximately thirty seconds and was transported to the emergency room, where he was diagnosed with a concussion.  

16. Plaintiff incurred medical expenses of approximately $4,500 and, due to taking time off work to care for his injured son, sustained wage losses of approximately $1,200.  

17. Plaintiff’s son continues to experience symptoms related to the concussion, including headaches and difficulty concentrating.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**(Negligence)**  

18. Plaintiff incorporates by reference and re-alleges all preceding paragraphs as if set forth fully herein.  

19. Defendant owed a duty of care to exercise reasonable supervision to ensure the safety of the children entrusted to its care, including Plaintiff’s minor son. See Turner v. Jordan, 957 F.2d 815, 820 (1st Cir. 1992); Mullins v. Pine Manor College, 389 Mass. 47 (1983).  

20. Defendant also had a specific duty to comply with its representations to parents that children in the after-school program would be "supervised at all times." See M.G.L. c. 93A, § 2.  

21. Defendant breached its duty of care by failing to maintain adequate supervision of the children in the gymnasium, despite the foreseeable risk of harm posed by unsupervised children engaging in rough play. See Leavitt v. Brockton Hosp., Inc., 454 Mass. 37 (2009).  

22. Defendant further breached its duty of care when its employee failed to address the specific reports of unsafe behavior, thereby allowing hazardous play to continue unchecked. See Quinn v. Morganelli, 73 Mass. App. Ct. 50, 53 (2008).  

23. Defendant’s negligence directly and proximately caused Plaintiff’s son’s injuries, including but not limited to a concussion and associated medical treatment. See Vintimilla v. O’Brien, 68 Mass. App. Ct. 1113 (2007).  

24. Defendant should have foreseen the substantial risk of harm from inadequate supervision, particularly given that the adult-to-child ratio was insufficient, and foreseeable complaints about roughhousing were ignored. See Jesionek v. Massachusetts Port Auth., 376 Mass. 101 (1978).  

25. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has incurred economic losses, including medical expenses and lost wages, as well as non-economic damages, including pain and suffering of Plaintiff’s minor son. See Wallace v. Wilson, 411 Mass. 8 (1991).  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court grant the following relief:  

A. Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but currently estimated to exceed $50,000, including but not limited to:  
   1. Medical expenses of approximately $4,500;  
   2. Lost wages of approximately $1,200; and  
   3. Damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress;  

B. Award Plaintiff pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;  

C. Award Plaintiff costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees as allowed by law;  

D. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.  

**JURY DEMAND**  

Plaintiff respectfully demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
