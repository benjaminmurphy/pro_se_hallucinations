Jessica Collins, Plaintiff,  
v.  
Michael Collins, Defendant.  
_________________________________________  
**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY**  

**NOW COMES THE PLAINTIFF, Jessica Collins, in the above-entitled matter, and hereby requests that this Honorable Court modify the current custody order concerning the minor child, Samantha Collins, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and other applicable laws. In support of this Complaint, the Plaintiff states as follows:**  

---

### **1. Parties**

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Collins, resides in Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  
2. The Defendant, Michael Collins, resides in Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  

---

### **2. Jurisdiction and Venue**

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 209C, § 1, and G.L. c. 208, § 28.  
4. Venue is proper in Middlesex County because the original custody order was entered in this Court and both parties currently reside in Middlesex County.  

---

### **3. Factual Background**

5. The Plaintiff and Defendant are the parents of Samantha Collins, age twelve, born on June 2, 2013.  
6. On May 14, 2019, this Court issued a judgment establishing shared physical custody, granting the Plaintiff and Defendant parenting time on an alternating weekly basis.  
7. At the time the existing custody arrangement was ordered, both parties resided nearby, were of sound health, and equally capable of providing consistent care.  
8. The parties have adhered to the 50/50 shared custody arrangement since May 2019, and the arrangement initially served the best interests of the child.  

---

### **4. Material Change in Circumstances**

9. Since the issuance of the 2019 custody order, there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances.  
10. The Defendant, Michael Collins, has been diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition that impacts his physical mobility and his ability to safely care for their minor child.  
11. Defendant has fallen at home on multiple occasions and has received medical advice warning against caring for Samantha in situations involving stairs or circumstances requiring quick physical responses.  
12. Despite receiving this medical advice, Defendant has continued to insist on adherence to a shared parenting schedule, during which Samantha, now age twelve, is occasionally required to assist the Defendant with tasks such as moving from a wheelchair to bed, retrieving medications, or other caregiving duties inappropriate for a child.  
13. The Plaintiff has observed that these responsibilities create emotional stress for Samantha and pose a risk to her safety and well-being.  
14. Samantha requires a safe and stable environment, free from situations where her health, safety, and emotional development may be compromised.  
15. The continued application of the current custody arrangement does not adequately address the child’s best interests under the newly arisen circumstances.  

---

### **5. Best Interests of the Child**  

16. Massachusetts law holds that the best interests of the child are the paramount concern in custody determinations. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704, 711 (1985).  
17. The safety, stability, and welfare of the child are central to this Court’s review. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 840 (2003).  
18. The Plaintiff has been and continues to be capable of providing Samantha with a stable and supportive environment that prioritizes her best interests.  
19. A modification of the current custody order to grant the Plaintiff primary physical custody, with an appropriate parenting schedule for the Defendant in keeping with his abilities, is in the child’s best interests.  
20. This request is not meant to penalize the Defendant due to his medical condition but rather to protect the well-being of the child in accordance with the principles set forth in Familias Unidas por la Educación v. Bresnahan, 501 Mass. 839 (2020).  

---

### **6. Prayer for Relief**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Modify the existing custody order to grant the Plaintiff, Jessica Collins, primary physical custody of the minor child, Samantha Collins.  
2. Establish a parenting schedule that provides the Defendant, Michael Collins, with parenting time consistent with his medical capabilities and the child’s best interests.  
3. Grant any further relief that this Court deems just and proper.
