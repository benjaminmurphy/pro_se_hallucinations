      "support_reasoning": "The opinion does address the covenant of quiet enjoyment, but it concerns interference from drug activity and the landlord\u2019s failure to take measures against nontenants, not failure to maintain physical conditions like rodent infestations. The court expressly cabins habitability to physical defects and treats quiet enjoyment here as turning on failure to act against third-party criminal activity, without suggesting that general uninhabitability or vermin infestations themselves constitute a quiet enjoyment breach. Thus, the case does not stand for the specific proposition that failure to maintain habitable conditions, including rodent infestations, violates the covenant of quiet enjoyment.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe covenant of quiet enjoyment protects a tenant\u2019s right to freedom from serious interference with his tenancy \u2014 acts or omissions that impair the character and value of the leasehold. \u2026 Thus, a landlord may not intend to violate a tenant\u2019s right to quiet enjoyment, but may do so nevertheless when the breach is a \u2018natural and probable consequence of what the landlord did, what he failed to do, or what he permitted to be done.\u2019 \u2026 If the defendant failed to take any action to remove from the area of its control persons engaged in unlawful activity, then the defendant permitted a condition to exist that substantially interfered with the tenancies of the plaintiffs and thus breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment.\u201d"

      "support_confidence": "high",
      "support_reasoning": "Blackett addresses breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and constructive eviction where landlords allowed and failed to control extreme noise from a commercial lounge they had introduced near residential units. The case does not discuss habitability standards generally, sanitary conditions, or rodent infestation, and its reference to premises being \"reasonably habitable\" is in the context of intolerable noise. Thus, while it supports that serious landlord\u2011created disturbances can breach quiet enjoyment, it does not specifically support the proposition that failure to address a rodent infestation violates the covenant of quiet enjoyment.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cBecause the disturbing condition was the natural and probable consequence of the landlords\u2019 permitting the lounge to operate where it did and because the landlords could control the actions at the lounge, they should not be entitled to collect rent for residential premises which were not reasonably habitable. Tenants such as these should not be left only with a claim against the proprietors of the noisome lounge.\u201d"
