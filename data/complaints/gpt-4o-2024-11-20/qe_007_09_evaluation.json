The court expressly states that the landlord\u2019s intentions are irrelevant and that liability may arise from failures to act (e.g., failing to take reasonable measures to remove dangerous nontenants), which aligns with the proposition that interference need not be malicious or in bad faith. Thus, the case supports the claimed principle under Massachusetts statutory and common law of quiet enjoyment.",

Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 716 (1977). Thus, a landlord may not intend to violate a tenant\u2019s right to quiet enjoyment, but may do so nevertheless when the breach is a \u2018natural and probable consequence of what the landlord did, what he failed to do, or what he permitted to be done.\u2019\u201d"

The opinion clarifies that strict liability without fault is not enough, but it clearly rejects any requirement of malice or bad faith.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "At common law, and as originally enacted by statute, the covenant of quiet enjoyment prohibited a landlord from wilful or intentional interference with a tenant\u2019s quiet enjoyment of the leased premises. In 1973, the statute was rewritten and the requirement of intentional conduct was eliminated; landlords could now be held liable for \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d interfering with a tenant\u2019s quiet enjoyment of the premises. \u2026 we rejected a claim that a violation of G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, could be imposed only if it were proved that a landlord was reckless \u2026 and we concluded that negligent conduct\u2026 could support the imposition of liability under \u00a7 14."

Instead, the court finds no interference with quiet enjoyment on these facts, so this case does not support the claimed proposition about construction noise.",

The court\u2019s quiet enjoyment discussion focuses on sewage flooding as an interference and on the statutory framework of G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 14; it nowhere addresses construction activity or noise as a basis for violating the covenant of quiet enjoyment. Thus, citing this case for the specific proposition about significant construction noise is inaccurate.",

The court focuses on the landlord\u2019s responsibility for objectionable noise created by a commercial tenant and the resulting loss of habitability, but it does not discuss negligent management of construction or define \u201cserious interference\u201d in the broader way asserted.

      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cBecause the disturbing condition was the natural and probable consequence of the landlords\u2019 permitting the lounge to operate where it did and because the landlords could control the actions at the lounge, they should not be entitled to collect rent for residential premises which were not reasonably habitable. Tenants such as these should not be left only with a claim against the proprietors of the noisome lounge\u2026 we decline to perpetuate that distinction where the landlord creates a situation and has the right to control the objectionable conditions.\u201d"
