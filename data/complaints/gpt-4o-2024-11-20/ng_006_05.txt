**COMPLAINT**  

**INTRODUCTION**  

1. This is a negligence action arising out of an incident that occurred on August 15, 2023, at or around 1234 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts. The Plaintiff, Jordan Reynolds, sustained personal injuries and property damage caused by the negligent actions of a rideshare driver employed or contracted by Defendant, QuickRide Rideshare, LLC.  

2. Plaintiff seeks to recover damages for physical injuries, medical expenses, lost wages, property damage, and pain and suffering caused by the Defendant’s negligence.  

**PARTIES**  

3. Plaintiff, Jordan Reynolds (“Plaintiff”), is an individual residing in Boston, Massachusetts.  

4. Defendant, QuickRide Rideshare, LLC (“Defendant”), is, upon information and belief, a corporation or similar business entity engaged in the business of offering rideshare services in Massachusetts and maintains its headquarters or principal place of business at a location known to the Plaintiff.
  
**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

5. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action under G.L. c. 212, § 4, as the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000.  

6. Venue is proper in Suffolk County pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1 because the acts and omissions complained of occurred in Suffolk County, Massachusetts.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

7. On August 15, 2023, at or around 8:00 a.m., Plaintiff was cycling in a designated bike lane on Commonwealth Avenue in Boston, Massachusetts, a public roadway.  

8. Commonwealth Avenue has marked bike lanes intended to provide a safe space for cyclists, and Plaintiff was riding in accordance with all applicable traffic laws and regulations.  

9. A driver employed or contracted by Defendant was parked in a loading zone directly adjacent to the bike lane.  

10. Without warning and without checking his side mirror, the Defendant’s driver opened his vehicle door into the bike lane, directly into Plaintiff’s path.  

11. As a result, Plaintiff collided with the door and was thrown from their bicycle, landing hard on the pavement.  

12. Plaintiff’s injuries from the collision included significant road rash on their arms and legs, dental damage in the form of a chipped front tooth, and property damage to their bicycle, which sustained a bent frame.  

13. At the scene, the Defendant's driver admitted that he did not see Plaintiff because he was distracted by checking his phone.  

14. The Defendant’s driver’s failure to exercise reasonable care in opening his door caused Plaintiff to endure severe pain, incur medical expenses, and suffer lost income from missed work.  

15. Plaintiff has further suffered emotional distress from the accident and continues to experience discomfort and inconvenience as a result of the Defendant’s negligence.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION: NEGLIGENCE**  

16. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all allegations of fact set forth above.  

17. Under Massachusetts law, every person has a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid causing harm to others. See *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000).  

18. In particular, drivers have a specific duty to ensure that opening a car door can be done safely without endangering passing cyclists or pedestrians. See *Massachusetts General Laws c. 90, § 14*, which requires that motorists exercise “due care” and explicitly protects bicyclists by prohibiting actions like opening car doors into traffic without precaution.  

19. Defendant, through its employee or agent, breached this duty by failing to check for oncoming cyclists before opening the vehicle door, creating an imminent hazard to Plaintiff.  

20. Defendant’s employee acted negligently in several respects, including but not limited to:  

    a. Failing to exercise reasonable care to ensure that opening the vehicle door did not endanger cyclists;  
    b. Failing to keep a proper lookout for cyclists traveling in the bike lane; and  
    c. Failing to refrain from opening the vehicle door while distracted by a mobile device.  

21. Defendant is vicariously liable for the negligence of its driver under the doctrine of respondeat superior because the acts and omissions occurred within the scope of the driver’s employment or engagement with Defendant. See *Dias v. Brigham Med. Assocs., Inc.*, 438 Mass. 317, 319 (2002).  

22. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained physical injuries, emotional harm, and economic losses.  

23. Plaintiff’s medical expenses stemming from the incident are approximately $1,200.  

24. Plaintiff also suffered approximately $400 in lost income due to time missed from work resulting from their injuries and recovery.  

25. Plaintiff has incurred additional costs to replace their damaged bicycle.  

26. Plaintiff has further suffered non-economic damages, including pain, emotional distress, and a diminished quality of life as a result of Defendant's negligence.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment against Defendant and award the following relief:  
A. Compensatory damages, including but not limited to:  
   1. Medical expenses incurred in the amount of approximately $1,200;  
   2. Lost wages in the amount of approximately $400;  
   3. The costs of replacing Plaintiff’s bicycle as proven at trial;  
   4. Non-economic damages for pain, suffering, and emotional distress as determined by the Court or jury;  
B. Prejudgment interest pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B;  
C. Costs of suit;  
D. Any other relief that this Court deems just and proper.  

**JURY DEMAND**  

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,  
This 1st day of December, 2025.
