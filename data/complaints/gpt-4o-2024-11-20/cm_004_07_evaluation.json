While the case is not a modification proceeding itself and does not use the phrase \"material change in circumstances,\" Massachusetts law generally requires such a change for modification, and the court\u2019s discussion presumes the modifiability of custody/visitation orders consistent with that framework. Thus the case indirectly supports the proposition that custody/visitation orders can be modified under Massachusetts law when circumstances warrant.",
