### COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
### BOSTON HOUSING COURT  

**Jessica Monroe,**  
*Plaintiff,*  
v.  
**Samuel Larkin,**  
*Defendant.*  

**Civil Action No.:** ___________________  

**COMPLAINT**  

**PARTIES**  

1. *Plaintiff Jessica Monroe* is a resident of Boston, Massachusetts, residing at 245 Centre Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130, pursuant to a written lease agreement with Defendant.  
2. *Defendant Samuel Larkin* is the landlord of the property located at 245 Centre Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130, and resides or conducts business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

3. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to M.G.L. c. 185C, § 3, as this action concerns the rights of a residential tenant.  
4. Venue is proper in this Court as the property at issue lies within Boston Housing Court's jurisdiction.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

5. On January 15, 2023, Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant for a studio apartment located at 245 Centre Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130, with monthly rent of $1,450.  
6. During the showing of the property, Plaintiff observed water stains on the ceiling of the apartment and inquired about their origin. Defendant assured Plaintiff the stains were from an old leak that had been "totally fixed."  
7. Beginning with the first substantial rainstorm after Plaintiff moved in, water began dripping from the ceiling in the same location as the water stains Plaintiff had previously observed.  
8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the issue. Defendant minimized Plaintiff’s concerns, referring to the problem as a “minor cosmetic issue” and suggesting Plaintiff had accepted such defects as part of the apartment’s supposed “character.”  
9. Over the subsequent months, the ceiling leak worsened. During one storm, water dripping from the ceiling soaked Plaintiff’s couch and ruined a laptop on her coffee table, requiring her to replace the device at a cost of $900.  
10. Plaintiff has repeatedly notified Defendant of the ongoing leaks and requested repairs. Defendant has failed to adequately remedy the situation.  
11. Due to the persistent leaks and lack of repairs, the apartment has developed a musty odor, likely caused by mold, which is now affecting Plaintiff’s health, as she has developed recurring headaches.  
12. The damage caused by the leaks and ongoing mold issue has rendered a substantial portion of the apartment effectively uninhabitable. For instance, Plaintiff had to move her bed away from the affected area and now lives in only part of the apartment.  

**CAUSES OF ACTION**  

**COUNT I: Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (M.G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  

13. Plaintiff repeats and realleges all foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  
14. Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, every lease agreement in Massachusetts includes a covenant of quiet enjoyment, which guarantees a tenant's right to use and enjoy the leased premises without substantial interference by the landlord.  
15. Defendant’s failure to address and remediate the ongoing water leaks and mold growth constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, as these conditions substantially interfere with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the apartment.  
16. Massachusetts caselaw holds that a landlord’s failure to maintain rental premises in habitable condition can amount to a violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273, 276 (1994).  
17. The inconvenience, health hazards, and damage to Plaintiff's personal property caused by Defendant's inaction and delay have substantially impaired Plaintiff’s enjoyment of the apartment. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 102 (1982).  
18. Defendant’s dismissive responses to Plaintiff’s complaints, as well as his refusal to undertake reasonable repairs, further demonstrate his breach of this covenant. See *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, 410 Mass. 855, 872 (1991).  

**DAMAGES**  

19. As a result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered the following damages:  
   a. The loss of her laptop, valued at approximately $900;  
   b. Substantial interference with her ability to use and enjoy the rental premises;  
   c. Physical and emotional distress, including recurring headaches caused by mold exposure; and  
   d. Diminished value of the rental property for the duration of her tenancy.  

20. Plaintiff is entitled to a reduction in rent, reimbursement for personal property damage, and compensation for emotional and physical distress, as well as treble damages under M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, which imposes strict liability for interference with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Monroe respectfully requests that this Court grant the following relief:  
1. Award Plaintiff damages in the amount of $900 for personal property lost due to Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;  
2. Award Plaintiff three times her actual damages pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186, § 14;  
3. Reduce Plaintiff’s rent for the duration of the ongoing interference with her quiet enjoyment;  
4. Award Plaintiff attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186, § 14; and  
5. Award such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

**JURY DEMAND**  

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,  

Dated: December 1, 2025
