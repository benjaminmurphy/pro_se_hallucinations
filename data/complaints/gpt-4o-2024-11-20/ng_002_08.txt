**JESSICA TURNER**,  
Plaintiff,  
v.  
**MARK SULLIVAN**,  
Defendant.  

**CIVIL ACTION NO. ___________**  

**COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND**  

**INTRODUCTION**  
This is a civil action for negligence brought by Plaintiff Jessica Turner against Defendant Mark Sullivan for injuries sustained as a result of Defendant’s failure to comply with local leash laws and his negligence in failing to control his dog, which caused Plaintiff to fall and suffer a fractured wrist.  

**PARTIES**  
1. Plaintiff Jessica Turner ("Plaintiff") is an individual residing in Newton, Massachusetts.  
2. Defendant Mark Sullivan ("Defendant") is an individual who, upon information and belief, resides or conducts business in Newton, Massachusetts.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19, which grants the District Court concurrent jurisdiction over tort cases where the damages claimed do not exceed $50,000.  
4. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1, as the events giving rise to this action occurred in Newton, Massachusetts.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
5. On September 15, 2023, Plaintiff was jogging on the designated public pathway located within Parks and Recreation Trails, 45 Park Ave, Newton, Massachusetts (the "park").  
6. The pathways throughout the park are marked with prominent signage stating that dogs must be kept on a leash at all times, in accordance with Newton’s local by-laws and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts laws regarding dog control.  
7. Defendant was present in the park with his dog, which was not on a leash, even though Defendant was holding the leash over his shoulder.  
8. Defendant negligently allowed his dog to roam free and did not maintain control of the dog while engaging in conversation with other individuals approximately thirty feet away.  
9. While jogging, Plaintiff encountered Defendant’s unleashed dog, which charged toward Plaintiff, barking loudly and aggressively.  
10. As a result of the dog’s sudden and threatening approach, Plaintiff, fearing for her safety, swerved off the pathway to avoid the dog and tripped on an exposed tree root.  
11. Plaintiff fell down a small embankment, suffering a fractured wrist.  
12. Defendant failed to call the dog back or attempt to restrain the dog in a timely manner until after Plaintiff had already fallen.  
13. Several witnesses, including other joggers present at the park, observed the incident.  

**INJURIES AND DAMAGES**  
14. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff sustained the following injuries and losses:  
    a. A fractured wrist, necessitating emergency medical treatment;  
    b. Out-of-pocket medical expenses of approximately $3,200;  
    c. Lost wages of approximately $1,500 due to an inability to work while Plaintiff’s wrist was healing;  
    d. Mental and emotional distress related to the incident and the interference with Plaintiff’s professional and personal activities, including her inability to participate in a piano recital she had been preparing for; and  
    e. Other general damages to be proven at trial.  

**COUNT ONE: NEGLIGENCE**  
15. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth herein.  
16. Under Massachusetts law, negligence is established when the defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff, the defendant breached that duty, the breach caused the plaintiff’s injuries, and the plaintiff suffered actual damages as a result of the injuries. **See Glidden v. Maglio, 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000)**.  
17. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of care both as the owner of a dog and as a user of the park to act reasonably to avoid creating foreseeable risks of harm to others. **See Irwin v. Ware, 392 Mass. 745, 756 (1984)**.  
18. Defendant breached this duty by failing to control his dog and by violating local and state leash laws, which are intended to protect members of the public, such as Plaintiff, from harm. **See G.L. c. 140, § 173; Fahey v. Rockwell Graphics Sys., Inc., 20 Mass. App. Ct. 642, 647 (1985)**.  
19. Defendant knew or should have known that allowing his dog to roam off-leash in an area frequented by joggers and pedestrians created a foreseeable risk of harm. **See Galluzzi v. Beverly Enters., Inc., 383 Mass. 707, 711 (1981)**.  
20. Defendant’s negligence in failing to control his dog was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries. **See Mullins v. Pine Manor College, 389 Mass. 47, 57 (1983)**.  
21. Plaintiff’s injuries and damages were foreseeable consequences of Defendant’s actions. **See Kourouvacilis v. Gen. Motors Corp., 410 Mass. 706, 716 (1991)**.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Turner respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and award the following relief:  
1. Compensatory damages in the amount of $4,700 for medical expenses and lost wages;  
2. General damages to compensate Plaintiff for pain, suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life, in an amount to be determined at trial;  
3. Pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;  
4. Attorneys’ fees and costs of this litigation, if applicable; and  
5. Any other relief the Court deems just and appropriate.  

**JURY DEMAND**  
Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
