It does not involve landlord\u2011tenant law, covenants of quiet enjoyment, or landlord liability for interference caused by other tenants. Because the case neither discusses nor implies rules about quiet enjoyment or landlord obligations to address tenant-caused interference, it does not support the claimed proposition.",

We construe the findings of the master as establishing that the brook which ran through the land of the defendants was a natural watercourse\u2026 The obstruction of a watercourse so as to cause the water to flow over a highway is a public nuisance.\u2026 A town is under a duty to keep its ways in repair and is liable to travellers injured by reason of a breach of that duty.\u201d"

It explicitly rejects a strict non-liability rule for tenant-on-tenant interference and emphasizes that liability arises when the interference is the natural and probable consequence of what the landlord did or failed to do and where the landlord had the right and ability to control the objectionable conditions.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cBecause the disturbing condition was the natural and probable consequence of the landlords\u2019 permitting the lounge to operate where it did and because the landlords could control the actions at the lounge, they should not be entitled to collect rent for residential premises which were not reasonably habitable. Tenants such as these should not be left only with a claim against the proprietors of the noisome lounge\u2026. [W]e decline to perpetuate [the] distinction [between nonfeasance and malfeasance] where the landlord creates a situation and has the right to control the objectionable conditions.\u201d"
