**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**BROCKTON DISTRICT COURT**

**Maria Lopez,**  
Plaintiff,  
v.  
**John Harrison,**  
Defendant.  

**Civil Action No. [To be assigned by Clerk]**  

**COMPLAINT**  

**INTRODUCTION**  
1. This is a civil action brought by Plaintiff Maria Lopez against her landlord, Defendant John Harrison, for failure to remedy the lack of hot water in her rental unit for a significant period of time, thereby breaching the covenant of quiet enjoyment guaranteed to her under Massachusetts law, as well as Chapter 186, Section 14 of the General Laws.

**PARTIES**  
2. Plaintiff Maria Lopez is an adult resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts residing at 123 Maple Street, Brockton, MA 02301.  
3. Defendant John Harrison is an adult residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and, upon information and belief, owns and operates the residential rental property at 123 Maple Street, Brockton, MA 02301.

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
4. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 218, § 19, as this matter is a civil case that includes damages below the threshold amount for jurisdiction in the Superior Court.  
5. Venue is proper in Brockton District Court pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223, §§ 8 and 9, as the property in question is located in Brockton and the Defendant resides in Massachusetts.

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
6. On or about June 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a rental agreement with Defendant for the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Brockton, MA 02301 (the “Apartment”).  
7. Plaintiff timely and fully pays monthly rent of $1,200.00.  
8. Pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14, a landlord is prohibited from interfering with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the premises and must maintain the property in habitable condition, including the obligation to provide continuous access to hot water for tenants.   
9. For approximately three weeks as of the date of this filing, the Apartment has been without hot water, which is essential for bathing, cleaning, and other daily household activities.  
10. Plaintiff immediately notified Defendant of the lack of hot water on or about November 10, 2025, the same day she became aware of the issue.  
11. Defendant stated the hot water heater required a replacement part and that the part had been ordered.  
12. Despite repeated promises to repair the hot water system, Defendant failed to remedy the issue within a reasonable time.  
13. Defendant’s failure to repair the system has forced Plaintiff and her family to endure cold showers and boil water for basic cleaning and dishwashing.  
14. Plaintiff has incurred additional expenses as a direct result of Defendant’s failure to maintain habitable living conditions, including gym memberships to access hot showers and travel costs associated with commuting to her mother’s home to bathe her infant child.  
15. Defendant’s actions, or failure to act, resulted in a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Apartment.  
16. The lack of hot water, a basic and essential service, renders the Apartment uninhabitable in violation of the implied warranty of habitability and Massachusetts law.

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**Count I: Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  
17. Plaintiff incorporates the allegations above as if fully set forth herein.  
18. Defendant’s failure to provide hot water for a period of approximately three weeks constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment guaranteed under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14.  
19. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14 provides that any tenant whose quiet enjoyment is substantially interfered with may recover actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater.  
20. Defendant’s failure to repair or restore hot water in a timely manner was not justified and significantly affected Plaintiff's ability to use and enjoy the Apartment.

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Maria Lopez respectfully requests that this Court grant the following relief:  
A. An award of damages in the amount of $450.00 for actual expenses incurred due to Defendant’s failure to provide hot water;  
B. Damages of three months’ rent ($3,600.00) pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14;  
C. Costs and reasonable attorney’s fees as mandated by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14;  
D. Interest as provided by law; and  
E. Any such other relief as this Court deems just and proper.

**JURY DEMAND**  
Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

Respectfully submitted,  
Dated: December 1, 2025
