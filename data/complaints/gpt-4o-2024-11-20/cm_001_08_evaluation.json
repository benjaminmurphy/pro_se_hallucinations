The court\u2019s analysis is confined to statutory construction of the public records statute and its exemptions, and contains no discussion of material change in circumstances, best interests of children, or any family-law standard.

The quoted portions focus on initial custody determinations under \u00a7\u00a7 31 and 31A, and removal under \u00a7 30, not post\u2011judgment modification.

It emphasizes that joint custody is appropriate only where parents can cooperate in a relatively stable, amicable fashion, and the court upholds sole custody to the primary nurturing parent to avoid conflict and promote the children\u2019s well-being. This aligns with the proposition that stability, predictability, and overall well-being are paramount in custody decisions.",
