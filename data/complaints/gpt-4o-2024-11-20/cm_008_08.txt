**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**SUFFOLK COUNTY PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT**

**No. [Case Number To Be Assigned]**

**Rachel Thompson,**  
Plaintiff  
v.  
**Mark Johnson,**  
Defendant  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY**

**INTRODUCTION**

Now comes Plaintiff, **Rachel Thompson**, residing at [Your Current Address], who files this Complaint for Modification of Custody pursuant to M.G.L. c. 208, § 28 and applicable case law, seeking a modification of the custody order entered by this Honorable Court on **May 15, 2022**. A material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred such that modification is warranted in the best interests of the minor child, **Samantha Johnson**, born **[Birth Date]**, now 10 years old.

**PARTIES**

1. Plaintiff, **Rachel Thompson**, is the minor child’s mother and resides at [Your Address], in Suffolk County, Massachusetts.  
2. Defendant, **Mark Johnson**, is the minor child’s father and resides at [Other Parent's Address] in [City, State, Zip].  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to M.G.L. c. 208, § 28 because both parties and the minor child reside in Massachusetts, and the original custody judgment was issued by this Court.  

4. Venue is proper in Suffolk County because the child and parents reside within this jurisdiction.

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5. On **May 15, 2022**, this Court entered a judgment of joint legal custody and parenting time, designating the Plaintiff as the primary residential parent and granting the Defendant substantial weekend parenting time, including Sunday nights. Both parties were ordered to cooperate and make joint decisions regarding the child’s education and school-related matters.

6. At the time the judgment was entered, the minor child, **Samantha Johnson**, was excelling academically, attending school regularly, and engaging in weekly tutoring sessions designed to support her learning development.  

7. Over the past year, the Defendant has failed to ensure the child’s regular attendance at school. Specifically, on **multiple occasions**, the Defendant has kept the child home from school on **Mondays** following his weekend parenting time, citing the need for the child to take “mental health days.” No doctor’s note has been provided to excuse these absences.

8. As a result of these repeated absences, **Samantha Johnson** has received **truancy warnings** from her school, and her academic performance has declined significantly. Her grades and standardized test scores have dropped from her previously high performance levels.  

9. Additionally, the Defendant consistently refuses to take the child to tutoring sessions that fall on his parenting weekends, further exacerbating her academic struggles.

10. The Plaintiff has made numerous good-faith attempts to address these issues with the Defendant and fulfill her obligation to **cooperate on school matters**, as required under the existing custody order. However, the Defendant has been uncooperative, failing to prioritize the child’s educational needs.

11. The Plaintiff has been left with no option but to seek relief from this Court to ensure the child’s educational needs are met and her welfare is safeguarded.

**MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

12. The following material changes in circumstances warrant a modification of the existing custody order:

   a. The child’s declining academic performance, attributable to her inconsistent school attendance during the Defendant’s parenting time.  
   b. The Defendant’s repeated interference with the child’s tutoring schedule.  
   c. The truancy warnings received by the Plaintiff stemming from the Defendant’s school absences.  

13. These changes directly impact the child’s educational well-being, which is a critical factor in determining her best interests under M.G.L. c. 208, § 28.

**REQUESTED MODIFICATION**

14. In light of the above, the Plaintiff requests the following modification of the existing custody order:  

   a. An order granting the Plaintiff decision-making authority with final say over all matters related to the minor child’s education, including, but not limited to, school attendance and tutoring.  
   b. Reducing the Defendant’s Sunday overnight parenting time to ensure the child’s attendance at school on Mondays.  

**LEGAL STANDARD AND SUPPORTING AUTHORITIES**

15. Pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 208, § 31**, the central inquiry for custody and parenting time modifications is the best interests of the child, including the child’s educational needs.  

16. Massachusetts courts have consistently upheld custody modifications when a material and substantial change in circumstances affects the child’s welfare. See, e.g., *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006) (holding that the court must focus on the child’s needs and welfare).  

17. Courts recognize that inconsistent school attendance and a child’s declining academic performance directly impact their best interests and provide grounds for modifying parenting time. *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981) (court emphasized the importance of fostering educational development).  

18. The Defendant’s refusal to transport the child to tutoring, coupled with keeping her home from school without legitimate justification, frustrates the child’s right to an education and contravenes the principles outlined in *Hewitt v. Hewitt*, 2018 Mass. App. Unpub. LEXIS 298.  

19. This Court has the authority to modify the parenting schedule where a substantial interference with the child’s educational needs exists. See *Gerry v. Gerry*, 100 Mass. App. Ct. 1 (2021); *Califano v. Califano*, 74 Mass. App. Ct. 719 (2009).  

20. When co-parenting proves unworkable due to one party’s noncompliance, Massachusetts law permits modification to ensure the child’s interests are prioritized. *Hunter v. Hunter*, 990 N.E.2d 1091 (2013); M.G.L. c. 208, § 28.  

21. In matters concerning education, the courts have discretion to designate one parent as having decision-making authority where joint legal custody is no longer feasible. See *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540 (2010).  

**WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter an Order:**

1. Granting the Plaintiff final decision-making authority on all matters related to the minor child’s education.  
2. Modifying the parenting schedule to eliminate the Defendant’s Sunday overnight parenting time.  
3. Awarding such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.  

**Respectfully submitted,**
