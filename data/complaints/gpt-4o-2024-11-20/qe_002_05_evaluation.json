The case therefore does not stand for the general proposition that a landlord\u2019s failure to repair constitutes interference with quiet enjoyment; instead, it holds that under these facts there was no breach of quiet enjoyment. It is not appropriate authority to cite as affirmative support for the claimed proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cWe have interpreted this obligation to mean that the covenant of quiet enjoyment protects a tenant from serious interference with her tenancy. \u2026 Generally, the landlord must have had notice of the condition interfering with the tenant\u2019s quiet enjoyment of the premises, and he must have at least acted negligently in not alleviating the condition. \u2026 Here, York acted immediately upon being notified by Casey of the defective conditions. \u2026 We see no evidence in the record before us of interference with Casey\u2019s quiet enjoyment of the premises.\u201d"
