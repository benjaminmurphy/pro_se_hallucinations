### **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

6. Maria Gonzales entered into a lease agreement with Steven Thompson for the rental property located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, MA 01603, commencing on June 1, 2022.  

7. The agreed-upon monthly rent for the apartment is $1,200, which Ms. Gonzales has paid in full and on time throughout the duration of her tenancy.  

8. Beginning approximately three months ago, Maria Gonzales observed mouse droppings in the kitchen of the apartment.  

9. Ms. Gonzales promptly notified her landlord, Steven Thompson, of these conditions; however, his response was inadequate to address the problem.  

10. Mr. Thompson attempted minimal measures to address the issue, such as placing a few traps in the apartment, which failed to remedy the problem.  

11. The Defendant hired an exterminator for a single visit, but no further comprehensive pest control measures were undertaken despite the exterminator advising that more thorough treatment was necessary.  

12. The mouse infestation remains unresolved. Ms. Gonzales continues to find mouse droppings in her kitchen on a weekly basis.  

13. As a result of the infestation, Ms. Gonzales has incurred financial harms totaling approximately $280, which includes $200 for food contamination and an additional $80 for purchasing protective storage to safeguard her food from pest contamination.  

14. The persistent infestation has also caused the Plaintiff significant stress and anxiety, as she is unable to fully and comfortably use her kitchen for cooking or eating meals.  

15. Despite Ms. Gonzales’s ongoing complaints, Mr. Thompson has failed and refused to take the necessary actions to resolve the infestation, claiming such measures are “overkill” and “too expensive.”  

16. The continuing presence of mice and mouse droppings constitutes a health hazard and a persistent interference with the Plaintiff’s ability to use the property for its intended purpose as a safe and habitable dwelling.  

17. The Defendant’s failure to address the mouse infestation and provide a habitable residence violates his obligations as a landlord under Massachusetts law.  

18. The Defendant further caused a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, as codified in M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, due to his failure to remedy conditions that substantially impair the Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her rental property.

### **CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**Count I – Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (M.G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  

19. The Plaintiff incorporates and realleges the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through 18 as if fully stated herein.  

20. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord has a duty to provide tenants with quiet enjoyment of the leased premises, as codified in M.G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

21. The covenant of quiet enjoyment obligates landlords to ensure that tenants can use and enjoy their leased premises free from substantial interference caused by the landlord’s actions or inactions.  

22. The persistent mouse infestation substantially interferes with the Plaintiff’s use, comfort, and enjoyment of the leased premises.  

23. The Defendant’s failure to remedy the infestation despite being notified of the issue constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, as the Defendant has failed to take reasonable steps to maintain the property in a habitable condition.  

24. The conditions in the rental unit constitute a violation of M.G.L. c. 186, § 14 and actionable neglect on the part of the Defendant.  

25. The Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment has caused the Plaintiff financial losses, emotional distress, and impaired use of the premises.
