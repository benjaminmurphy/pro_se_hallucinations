Quirico, J. expressly endorses implying an obligation (whether styled warranty or covenant) that rented dwelling units meet minimum habitability standards and that this obligation is intertwined with the tenant\u2019s rent obligation. Although he criticizes the majority\u2019s broader \u2018implied warranty of habitability\u2019 formulation, he still recognizes a landlord responsibility to provide safe, habitable residential premises enforceable by tenants.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cI agree with the majority of the court that, at least as to dwelling units, the time has come to reconsider the rule so long imbedded in our law of landlord and tenant that \u2018[t]here is no implied agreement, apart from fraud, that the demised premises are or will continue to be fit for occupancy or safe and in good repair\u2026.\u2019 \u2026 I would reverse that rule and hold instead (a) that the various statutes\u2026 prescribing minimum standards for dwelling units impose on the landlord, for the benefit of his tenants, an obligation to comply with those minimum standards, and (b) that by renting such a unit the landlord impliedly agrees\u2026.\u201d"
