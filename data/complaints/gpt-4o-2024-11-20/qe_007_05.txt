  Plaintiff,  

v.  

**Michael Thompson,**  
  Defendant.  
______________________________  

**COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**  

**PARTIES**  

1. Plaintiff, Jessica Lin ("Plaintiff"), is an individual residing at 45 Harvard Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 02139. Plaintiff has been a tenant in the subject property since June 1, 2021, under a tenancy agreement with the Defendant.  

2. Defendant, Michael Thompson ("Defendant"), is the owner and landlord of the residential property located at 45 Harvard Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 02139. Defendant conducts business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as the lessor of the subject property.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19 and G.L. c. 185C, § 3 because this action involves residential rental property located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of this Court.  

4. Venue is proper in this Court under G.L. c. 223, § 1 because the incidents described herein occurred in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where the property is located.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

5. Plaintiff began her tenancy at the residential property located at 45 Harvard Street on or about June 1, 2021, and continues to reside there as a paying tenant. Plaintiff's monthly rent is $2,400, which is paid directly to Defendant.  

6. On or about October 1, 2025, Defendant began extensive renovation work in the apartment unit adjoining Plaintiff’s apartment. The renovation has resulted in persistent construction activities, including drilling, hammering, and loud conversations among workers.  

7. The construction noise typically commences at or around 8:00 AM and continues until 5:00 PM during weekdays, creating a disruptive environment. Plaintiff, who works from home, finds it exceedingly difficult to concentrate and participate in work calls due to the noise.  

8. Plaintiff has experienced dust infiltration into her apartment through the ventilation system as a result of the construction.  

9. Defendant informed Plaintiff in advance of the renovations but failed to take adequate measures to ensure that Plaintiff’s right to the quiet enjoyment of her leased premises would not be unreasonably interfered with.  

10. As mitigation, Defendant offered Plaintiff a $100 rent reduction for one month, which was insufficient in light of the substantial interference Plaintiff has experienced over the course of two months, with additional disruptions anticipated to extend for another one to two months.  

11. The extensive construction noise and dust have interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to peacefully use and enjoy her apartment, constituting a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law.  

12. Plaintiff has suffered substantial inconvenience, stress, and diminished quality of life as a result of Defendant’s ongoing failure to ensure her quiet enjoyment of the property. Plaintiff’s damages are estimated at $2,000.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14**  

13. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all of the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 12 of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein.  

14. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, every residential lease in Massachusetts includes a covenant of quiet enjoyment, which guarantees that tenants have the right to enjoy their homes free from substantial interference.  

15. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in law and protects tenants against actions or omissions by a landlord that result in a sustained interference with the use and enjoyment of the leased premises.  

16. Defendant, through his acts and omissions, has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment by permitting excessive construction noise and dust infiltration into Plaintiff's apartment, which has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s comfort, convenience, and use of her home.  

17. Massachusetts courts have consistently upheld tenants' rights under the covenant of quiet enjoyment, holding that substantial interference caused by a landlord constitutes a breach. See *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847, 853 (1997); *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273, 284 (1994).  

18. In *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 358 N.E.2d 817, 818 (Mass. App. Ct. 1976), the court held that a landlord could be liable for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment if their actions or negligence substantially interfered with a tenant's use of the premises, even if the landlord did not intend to cause a disturbance.  

19. The interference suffered by Plaintiff is significant, ongoing, and directly attributable to Defendant’s failure to take adequate measures to limit the impact of construction activities, in breach of the covenant.  

20. Defendant’s conduct is in contravention of G.L. c. 186, § 14, which provides entitlements to relief, including monetary damages, if the covenant of quiet enjoyment is breached.  

21. Plaintiff is entitled to recover damages as a result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Lin respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment against Defendant Michael Thompson and grant the following relief:  

1. An award of monetary damages in the amount of $2,000 for Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, in accordance with G.L. c. 186, § 14;  

2. Reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs if further proceedings necessitate the hiring of legal representation, as allowed under G.L. c. 186, § 14;  

3. Any other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.  

**JURY DEMAND**  

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,  
Dated: December 1, 2025
