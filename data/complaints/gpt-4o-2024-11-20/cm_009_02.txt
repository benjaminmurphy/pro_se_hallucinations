**LAURA SMITH,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MARK JOHNSON,**  
Defendant.  
**_________________________________________**  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Laura Smith, and respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the existing custody order entered on May 15, 2019, by eliminating the midweek overnight custody arrangement on Wednesdays and making other necessary adjustments to the parenting schedule to reflect a material change in circumstances and serve the best interests of the minor child, Emily Johnson, age 8. In support of this Complaint, Plaintiff states as follows:

---

### **PARTIES** 

1. **Plaintiff, Laura Smith**, is the mother of the minor child, Emily Johnson, and resides in [Town of Plaintiff's Residence], Massachusetts.  
2. **Defendant, Mark Johnson**, is the father of the minor child and resides in Cape Cod, Massachusetts.

---

### **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

1. The existing custody order was issued by this Court on May 15, 2019, and grants Plaintiff primary physical custody while providing Defendant parenting time every other weekend and one midweek overnight on Wednesdays.  
   
2. At the time the original custody order was entered, both parties resided in the same town, and Defendant’s midweek overnight visitation arrangement allowed a short, five-minute commute to drop the minor child off at school the following morning.  

3. Since the order was entered, a **material change in circumstances** has occurred. Specifically:  
   a. Defendant has relocated to Cape Cod, Massachusetts.  
   b. The relocation has greatly increased the travel distance between Plaintiff’s home, Defendant’s home, and the minor child’s school, with Defendant’s residence now over 90 miles away.  
   c. Defendant continues to insist on exercising Wednesday overnights, requiring the minor child to make a round-trip commute of approximately 180 miles during the school week.  

4. The midweek parenting time as presently arranged no longer serves the best interests of the minor child and has negatively impacted her wellbeing:  
   a. The long commutes require the minor child to wake up at approximately 4:30 AM on Thursdays in order to return to school by the start of the school day.  
   b. Emily’s teacher has observed that she frequently appears tired and her participation in school noticeably declines on Thursdays due to exhaustion.  

5. Maintaining the midweek overnight under these circumstances poses significant harm to the minor child and severely disrupts the stability and predictability needed in her daily schedule.

### **LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION**  

6. Pursuant to **Massachusetts General Laws c. 208, § 28**, this Court may modify any prior custody or parenting order when a material and substantial change has occurred since the entry of the prior judgment and such modification promotes the best interests of the child.

7. A parent’s relocation and the subsequent logistics related to parenting time are recognized as material changes in circumstances under Massachusetts law. See **Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006)**; **Abbott v. Virusso, 68 Mass. App. Ct. 326 (2007)**.  

8. In determining the best interests of the child, courts consider the child’s emotional, developmental, and educational needs. See **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985)**; **Hunter v. Rose, 463 Mass. 488, 495 (2012)**.  

9. The exhaustion and disruption caused by long midweek commutes directly undermine Emily’s ability to succeed in school and maintain a healthy routine, warranting modification under the principles established in **Kendall v. Kendall, 426 Mass. 238 (1997)** and **Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010)**.  

10. The Massachusetts courts have consistently held that parenting schedules must be adapted to reflect the realities of distance and travel time. See **Rosenwasser v. Rosenwasser, 89 Mass. App. Ct. 743 (2016)**; **Anderson v. McWalter, 950 N.E.2d 1105 (Mass. App. Ct. 2011)**.  

11. Additionally, Massachusetts public policy promotes the stability and wellbeing of children, which includes minimizing unnecessary disruption to their schooling. See **Schechter v. Schechter, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015)**; **Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981)**.

### **REQUESTED RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the original custody order was entered.  
2. Modify the current custody order to:  
   a. Eliminate the Wednesday midweek overnight parenting time due to its adverse impact on the minor child’s school performance and well-being.  
   b. Adjust the weekend parenting schedule, if appropriate, to ensure the child’s time with the Defendant remains meaningful while prioritizing her overall stability and welfare.  
3. Award such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.
