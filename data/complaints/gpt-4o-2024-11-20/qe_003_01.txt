### COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
### BOSTON HOUSING COURT  

**Olivia Martinez**  
Plaintiff,  
v.  
**James Houghton**  
Defendant.  

**Civil Action No.: [To Be Assigned]**  

**COMPLAINT**  

**I. INTRODUCTION**  

1. This is a civil action seeking damages for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts landlord-tenant law. Plaintiff Olivia Martinez alleges that Defendant James Houghton has failed to maintain her rental unit in a habitable condition, causing ongoing damage to her health, property, and use of her apartment. This failure violates Plaintiff’s statutory and common-law rights under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

---

**II. THE PARTIES**  

2. Plaintiff Olivia Martinez resides at 567 Jamaica Plain Ave, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130, where she rents a studio apartment from Defendant.  

3. Defendant James Houghton is the owner and landlord of the property located at 567 Jamaica Plain Ave, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts 02130.  

---

**III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

4. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court because the dispute involves obligations under a landlord-tenant relationship governed by Massachusetts law.  

5. Venue is proper in the Boston Housing Court as the property at issue is located in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts, and the Defendant conducts business in this jurisdiction.

**IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

6. Plaintiff entered into a written lease agreement with Defendant beginning February 1, 2023, for a studio apartment located at 567 Jamaica Plain Ave, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, for a monthly rent of $1,300.  

7. During the initial showing of the apartment prior to signing the lease, Plaintiff observed water stains on the ceiling. Upon inquiry, Defendant represented that the water stains were the result of an old leak that had been repaired and assured Plaintiff there were no ongoing issues with the unit.  

8. Shortly after moving in, during the first significant rainstorm, Plaintiff observed water leaking through the same spot on the ceiling where the stains were visible.  

9. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the leak. Defendant dismissed the issue as a "minor cosmetic problem" and refused to take steps to repair or mitigate the leaking.  

10. Over the following months, the water leakage worsened, causing damage to Plaintiff’s personal property, including the destruction of a laptop valued at approximately $900, and extensive soaking of her furniture and other belongings.  

11. The persistent water infiltration has caused significant mold growth in the apartment, resulting in a pervasive musty odor and contributing to ongoing health issues for Plaintiff, including headaches and difficulty breathing.  

12. Plaintiff has repeatedly notified Defendant of these issues and requested repairs, but Defendant has failed and refused to take reasonable steps to address the water infiltration or mold.  

13. The conditions of Plaintiff's apartment have seriously interfered with her use and enjoyment of the premises as a safe and habitable residence. Specifically, Plaintiff has had to remove her bed from the affected area and now effectively resides in only half of the apartment.  

14. Despite these conditions, Defendant has continued to collect full rent from Plaintiff, in breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment codified in G.L. c. 186, § 14.

**V. CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment - G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  

15. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth herein.  

16. Under Massachusetts law, G.L. c. 186, § 14 guarantees a tenant the right to quiet enjoyment of their rental property, free from serious interference by the landlord or their failure to make necessary repairs.  

17. Defendant’s failure to remedy the persistent water leakage, along with the resulting mold growth and damage to Plaintiff’s personal property, constitutes a clear breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  

18. These conditions have significantly interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her apartment and rendered the unit unsafe and unhealthy for habitation.  

19. Defendant has had actual or constructive notice of the unit’s defective condition since at least February 1, 2023, when Plaintiff first reported the issue, yet Defendant has failed to take reasonable action to correct the problem.  

20. Defendant’s conduct is deliberate, reckless, and in bad faith, in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14, entitling Plaintiff to remedies under Massachusetts law.  

**VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Olivia Martinez respectfully requests that the Court grant the following relief:  
1. An award of actual damages in the amount of $900 to compensate Plaintiff for losses caused by Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, including the cost of replacing damaged personal property;  
2. An award of attorney’s fees and costs pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14;  
3. An award of statutory damages, up to three times the amount of actual damages, as provided under G.L. c. 186, § 14;  
4. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
