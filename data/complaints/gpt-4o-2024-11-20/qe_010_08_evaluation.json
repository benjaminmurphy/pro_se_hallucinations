The landlord may be correct in characterizing itself as an innocent party, and we are cognizant of the economic burdens that a landlord typically bears. Nevertheless, we note that the landlord\u2019s liability without fault is merely an economic burden; the tenant living in an uninhabitable building suffers a loss of shelter, a necessity.\u201d"

It does not discuss mold, health hazards, or interference with tenants\u2019 quiet enjoyment. The case\u2019s analysis is limited to whether the condominium trustees and their managing agent were engaged in trade or commerce and whether the complaint stated a claim for abuse of process, so it cannot support a proposition about mold as a health hazard affecting quiet enjoyment.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "We conclude that the relationship between the Trustees and Albright is one of a private nature and falls, therefore, outside the scope of G.L.c. 93A... We disagree, concluding that CJA is not liable under G.L.c. 93A because it is not engaged in trade or commerce as those terms are used in the statute... 2. We conclude that Albright\u2019s complaint does, however, state a cause of action for abuse of process."

Thus, the case is correctly cited for the proposition that fitness for human habitation is directly tied to rental obligations in Massachusetts.",

The opinion of the court accomplishes this. However, the second step without the first will apply only to those very few cases in which the landlord has expressly agreed to repair or maintain the rented premises\u2026\u201d"

The court rejects a strict malfeasance/nonfeasance distinction and affirms judgments for tenants where the landlord, despite having control and notice, failed to abate noise from another leased premises.
