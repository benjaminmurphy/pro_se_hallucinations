**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
MIDDLESEX PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT  

**Docket No. ________**  

**JESSICA TAYLOR**,  
Plaintiff  

v.  

**MARK JOHNSON**,  
Defendant  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

**I. INTRODUCTION AND STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION**  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Taylor ("Plaintiff"), and files this Complaint for Modification of the existing custody order pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 209C, § 20. Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the parenting schedule established in the original Judgment of Custody and Visitation issued on September 15, 2018, by this Court. This Complaint is brought in light of a material change in circumstances that significantly affects the welfare of the minor child, Daniel Johnson.  

This Court retains jurisdiction over the matter as it pertains to custody and the parenting plan of the minor child pursuant to G.L. c. 209C, § 1 and relevant Massachusetts law.

**II. THE PARTIES**  

1. Plaintiff, Jessica Taylor, resides at [Address omitted for confidentiality purposes], Middlesex County, Massachusetts. She is the mother of Daniel Johnson and has had physical custody of him since the entry of the prior custody order.  
2. Defendant, Mark Johnson, resides at [Address omitted for confidentiality purposes], Middlesex County, Massachusetts. He is the father of Daniel Johnson and currently exercises visitation per the schedule established in the 2018 order.

**III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**  

3. The minor child, Daniel Johnson, born [DOB omitted for confidentiality], is the biological child of the Plaintiff and the Defendant.  

4. On September 15, 2018, the Middlesex Probate and Family Court issued an order granting the Plaintiff primary physical custody and the Defendant three short visits during weekdays and one Sunday afternoon visit per week. The schedule did not allow for the Defendant to have overnight parenting time.  

5. At the time of the original order, the Defendant did not have suitable living accommodations for overnight visits with the minor child. He lived in a room within a shared apartment with roommates and did not have a bedroom for Daniel.  

6. Since 2018, there has been a substantial change in circumstances. The Defendant now resides in his own apartment in Middlesex County. Importantly, the Defendant has secured a safe and stable home environment, including a fully furnished bedroom specifically designated for Daniel's use.  

7. Daniel, who is now eight years old, is in school full time and has expressed a desire to spend more meaningful time with the Defendant, including sleepovers at the Defendant’s residence.  

8. The current visitation schedule, designed for a three-year-old toddler, is no longer practical for an eight-year-old child with school, homework, and extracurricular commitments. The weekday visits are short and disruptive, requiring frequent travel, which interferes with the child’s bedtime, homework schedule, and general stability.  

9. The Plaintiff and Defendant both agree that the parenting schedule should be adjusted to reflect the current needs of the child and ensure a more balanced and practical arrangement.  

10. It is in the best interest of the minor child, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, to allow for overnight parenting time with the Defendant and to modify the current schedule to reduce disruptions to the child’s school routine and enhance the child’s relationship with both parents.

**IV. LEGAL STANDARD AND SUPPORTING AUTHORITY FOR MODIFICATION**  

11. Under Massachusetts law, a modification of custody or visitation requires a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior order and that the requested modification is in the best interest of the child. G.L. c. 208, § 28; See *Schaffer v. Schaffer*, 72 Mass. App. Ct. 449 (2008).  

12. Courts consider the current and future needs of the child and whether the existing parenting plan serves the child’s best interests. *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488, 492 (2012).  

13. The stability, health, and well-being of the child are paramount considerations. See *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 710 (1985); *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404 (1981).  

14. A modification is warranted when the existing schedule no longer effectively serves the child’s needs due to a change in circumstances. See *Prenaveau v. Prenaveau*, 81 Mass. App. Ct. 479 (2012).  

15. Courts recognize that maintaining strong and meaningful relationships with both parents serves a child’s best interests. See *Hale v. Hale*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 812, 820 (1981).  

16. The Massachusetts Guidelines for Shared Parenting highlight the importance of both parents maintaining consistent and substantial contact with their child to provide emotional and developmental support. See *Felton v. Felton*, 383 Mass. 232, 235-36 (1981).  

17. Here, the Defendant’s improved living conditions and the evolving needs of Daniel constitute material changes in circumstances that justify modifying the current parenting arrangement. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).  

18. The modification will provide Daniel with a stable, predictable parenting plan more suited to his developmental stage and his expressed desire to spend overnight time with the Defendant. See *Schechter v. Schechter*, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239, 246 (2015).  

**V. REQUESTED RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully prays that this Honorable Court:  

1. Find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the September 15, 2018, Judgment of Custody and Visitation.  
2. Modify the existing custody and visitation order to permit the Defendant to have overnight parenting time with Daniel Johnson.  
3. Establish a parenting schedule appropriate to the minor child’s age, school schedule, and best interests, including overnight visits and weekend parenting time with the Defendant.  
4. Provide such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.  

Respectfully submitted,
