The court applies a \u2018best interests of the child\u2019 standard specific to relocation, not a general \u2018material and substantial change in circumstances\u2019 standard for custody modification. While the opinion emphasizes that the court must focus on the child\u2019s best interests and welfare, it does not frame its analysis in terms of or endorse the \u2018material and substantial change in circumstances\u2019 requirement referenced in the proposition, so it only partially matches the claimed use and does not truly support it as phrased.",

The reduction of the father\u2019s visitation is tied to parental antagonism and incidents \u2018inconsistent with the best interests of the children,\u2019 not to inconsistent school attendance or deteriorating school performance.

In 1997, Andrews delivered a deed in lieu of foreclosure to the plaintiff, but the plaintiff did not record the deed. The city targeted the buildings for demolition . . . ."
