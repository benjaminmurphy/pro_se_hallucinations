However, it does not characterize a violation of the covenant as an independent tort; rather, it treats it as a contract-based covenant supplemented by a statutory cause of action with tort-like damages. Nowhere does the court state that breach of the covenant itself is an actionable tort, so the case does not support the proposition as phrased.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cSection 14 provides that tenants may recover \u2018actual and consequential\u2019 damages from landlords who have interfered with their quiet enjoyment of leased premises. We have noted that this provision was intended to expand the damages recoverable for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. \u2026 The combination in \u00a7 14 of both actual and consequential damages, therefore, suggests that the Legislature intended to include all reasonably foreseeable losses \u2014 personal as well as economic \u2014 within the scope of statutory recovery.\u201d"

The court\u2019s analysis of quiet enjoyment focuses on serious interference caused by the landlord\u2019s failure to act against third-party misconduct, not deprivation of utilities or other essential property features. Thus, it does not establish or affirm the specific principle that substantial time without an essential feature such as electricity constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.",
