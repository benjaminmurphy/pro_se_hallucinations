### COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  

### INTRODUCTION  
1. Plaintiff Emily Carter (“Plaintiff”) brings this action against Defendant James Thompson (“Defendant”) for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, as codified in Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 186, Section 14, due to Defendant’s failure to restore adequate hot water in Plaintiff’s rented premises despite a prolonged and unreasonable delay.  

### PARTIES  
2. Plaintiff Emily Carter is an individual residing at 45 Maple Street, Brockton, Massachusetts 02301.  
3. Defendant James Thompson is an individual who owns and manages the residential property located at 45 Maple Street, Brockton, Massachusetts 02301.  

### JURISDICTION AND VENUE  
4. This Court has jurisdiction under G.L. c. 218, § 19 because the damages sought are within the monetary jurisdiction of the District Court.  
5. Venue is proper as the rented premises are located in Brockton, Plymouth County, Massachusetts.  

### FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  
6. On or about May 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a lease for the residential apartment located at 45 Maple Street, Brockton, MA 02301. The monthly rental amount is $1,200.  
7. Defendant, as Plaintiff’s landlord, is obligated under Massachusetts law and the lease agreement to ensure the premises comply with the State Sanitary Code, 105 CMR 410.000 et seq., including the provision of adequate hot water.  
8. On or about November 10, 2025, Plaintiff’s hot water supply ceased functioning due to an issue with the water heater.  
9. That same day, Plaintiff contacted Defendant to report the lack of hot water. Defendant acknowledged the issue and claimed the water heater needed a replacement part, which he indicated had been ordered.  
10. On or about November 17, 2025, after still not having hot water for a week, Plaintiff again contacted Defendant to inquire about repairs. Defendant stated that the replacement part was backordered.  
11. On or about November 24, 2025, Plaintiff contacted Defendant again. Defendant reiterated that the part had not yet arrived and that he was “working on it.”  
12. As of December 1, 2025, more than three weeks after the issue was first reported, Defendant has failed to restore the hot water supply.  
13. During this time, Plaintiff has been forced to take cold showers, incur additional expenses for gym memberships and travel to shower offsite, and regularly travel with her infant child to her mother’s residence for bathing.  
14. Defendant’s failure to timely address the lack of hot water has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use, comfort, and enjoyment of her home, violating Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment guaranteed by G.L. c. 186, § 14.  
15. Plaintiff has suffered damages as a result of Defendant’s actions, including but not limited to loss of use of the premises, inconvenience, and additional expenses.  

### CAUSE OF ACTION  

#### COUNT I: BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT (G.L. c. 186, § 14)  
16. Plaintiff incorporates paragraphs 1 through 15 of this Complaint by reference as if restated in full herein.  
17. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with or disturbs a tenant’s use, enjoyment, and comfort of leased premises breaches the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  
18. Defendant’s failure to restore adequate hot water for over three weeks constitutes a direct interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises.  
19. Defendant, despite receiving Plaintiff’s repeated notifications of the issue, failed to promptly resolve the problem within a reasonable period of time, thereby violating the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law.  
20. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s actions, Plaintiff has suffered damages, including but not limited to interference with her daily living, additional expenses incurred for bathing, and inconvenience related to the lack of hot water.  

### PRAYER FOR RELIEF  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grant the following relief:  
1. Award Plaintiff $450 in compensatory damages for the costs and losses suffered as a result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;  
2. Award Plaintiff the costs of this action, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14;  
3. Grant any other relief that the Court deems just and proper.  

### REQUIREMENT OF NOTICE  
Plaintiff certifies under the provisions of G.L. c. 186, § 14 that Defendant has been sufficiently notified of the issues outlined in this Complaint and has failed to take appropriate corrective action.
