____________________________/  

**COMPLAINT**  

**I. INTRODUCTION**  

1. This is a civil action brought by Plaintiff Emily Carter ("Plaintiff") against her landlord, Defendant Robert Thompson ("Defendant"), for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 186, § 14. Plaintiff seeks damages for the substantial interference with her right to quiet enjoyment of her rental unit, which has caused her significant loss of sleep, emotional distress, and financial harm.

**II. PARTIES**  

2. Plaintiff Emily Carter resides at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02144. She has been a tenant at this property since January 1, 2022.  

3. Defendant Robert Thompson is the owner and landlord of the property at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02144.  

---

**III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

4. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in this Court under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 223, § 2, because this action arises out of events occurring in Somerville, Massachusetts, and the property at issue is located within this judicial district.

**IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

5. Plaintiff rents a second-floor apartment located at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02144 from Defendant. Her current lease began on or about January 1, 2022. Plaintiff pays $1,800 in monthly rent.  

6. Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 186, § 14, and as explicitly stated in Plaintiff's lease, Plaintiff is entitled to the quiet enjoyment of her rental apartment.  

7. Approximately six months ago, the tenants above Plaintiff moved into the building. Since then, those tenants have engaged in excessive noise-making at all hours, including but not limited to stomping, moving furniture late at night, and playing loud music late into the evening.  

8. Plaintiff has directly requested that the upstairs tenants lower their noise levels, and while they temporarily complied, the excessive noise resumed within short order.  

9. Plaintiff has notified Defendant of the ongoing noise issues at least five or six times and explained the significant impact it has had on her ability to enjoy her unit or sleep at night.  

10. Defendant informed Plaintiff on one occasion that he spoke to the upstairs tenants but stated he "can't control how people live." He failed to take any further steps to address the issue or to ensure Plaintiff's right to quiet enjoyment.  

11. As a direct result of the unrelenting noise, Plaintiff has suffered from extreme sleep deprivation, averaging only four to five hours of sleep per night over several months.  

12. Plaintiff received a written warning at her workplace for falling asleep at her desk. This issue has placed her employment in jeopardy.  

13. Plaintiff's doctor prescribed sleep medication to help address the noise-related sleep issues, costing Plaintiff $40 per month out of pocket.  

14. Plaintiff purchased earplugs, a white noise machine, and rearranged her bedroom in unsuccessful attempts to mitigate the noise levels.  

15. Despite Plaintiff's repeated complaints, Defendant has failed to take reasonable or meaningful steps to address the noise, thereby violating Plaintiff's right to quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law.  

16. As a proximate result of Defendant's breach of his obligations under Massachusetts law, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer substantial harm, including loss of sleep, emotional distress, and financial costs, including but not limited to medical expenses and the loss of enjoyment of her home.

**V. CAUSE OF ACTION**  

**(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14)**  

17. Plaintiff incorporates paragraphs 1 through 16 of this Complaint as though fully set forth herein.  

18. Under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 186, § 14, it is a landlord's obligation to ensure that a tenant may occupy their rental unit free from interference with their quiet enjoyment.  

19. The covenant of quiet enjoyment protects a tenant from "substantial interference" with their tenancy. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 102–03 (1982); *Al Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847, 849 (1997).  

20. Noise may constitute a substantial interference sufficient to violate the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273, 285 (1994); *Bosse v. City of Gloucester*, 6 Mass. App. Ct. 953 (1978).  

21. Defendant's failure to act reasonably to address the persistent and excessive noise at 123 Elm Street constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff's quiet enjoyment of her home.  

22. Defendant's conduct was deliberate or at least grossly negligent, as evidenced by his repeated refusal to take meaningful action in response to Plaintiff's numerous complaints. See *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714, 717–18 (1977).  

23. Plaintiff is entitled to recover actual damages resulting from Defendant's breach, including but not limited to damages for emotional distress and financial harm. See *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, 410 Mass. 855, 872 (1991).  

24. Plaintiff is also entitled to the statutory remedy of rent abatement due to Defendant's failure to uphold the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See *Armstrong v. Gabriel*, 15 Mass. App. Ct. 533, 537–38 (1983).

**VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grant the following relief:  

1. An award of damages in the amount of $1,200 to compensate Plaintiff for the harm caused by Defendant's breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, including but not limited to emotional distress and financial losses.  

2. An order abating Plaintiff's rent to reflect the loss of quiet enjoyment.  

3. Any additional damages deemed appropriate under Chapter 186, § 14 of Massachusetts law.  

4. An award of attorneys' fees and costs, to the extent permitted by law.  

5. Such other and further relief as the Court deems fair and just.
