**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**  

**INTRODUCTION**  
NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, and respectfully submits this Complaint for Modification of Custody Order pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and the rules and case law governing custody modifications in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The Plaintiff avers that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances that warrants modification of the existing custody arrangement entered by this Court on May 10, 2022, and that a modification would serve the best interests of the minor children, Emma Thompson (age 10) and Noah Thompson (age 8).  

**PARTIES**  
1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, resides at [Insert Address], resides within the jurisdiction of the Bristol County Probate and Family Court, and is the primary residential parent of the minor children.  
2. The Defendant, Michael Thompson, resides at [Insert Address] and is the father of the minor children and co-holder of shared legal custody under the existing order of May 10, 2022.  

**FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND ALLEGATIONS**  
3. The Plaintiff and Defendant are the parents of two minor children:  
    a. Emma Thompson, born [Insert Date of Birth for Emma]; and  
    b. Noah Thompson, born [Insert Date of Birth for Noah].  
4. On May 10, 2022, this Court entered an order for shared legal custody of the minor children, providing that they reside primarily with the Plaintiff but spend scheduled parenting time with the Defendant.  
5. Over the past year, circumstances have arisen that substantially interfere with the existing custody arrangement and harm the children’s well-being under the current order.  

6. Specifically, the Defendant has engaged in the following conduct that demonstrates a material and substantial change in circumstances:  
    a. The Defendant has unilaterally enrolled the minor children in extracurricular activities that conflict with the Plaintiff's scheduled parenting time, without consulting or seeking her agreement in violation of the shared legal custody order as articulated in *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981) (holding that shared legal custody requires meaningful communication and collaboration between parents).  
    b. The Defendant has created conflict and confusion for the children by blaming the Plaintiff when she cannot accommodate changed schedules, causing the children emotional distress in violation of the best interests standard established in *Stevens v. Stevens*, 337 Mass. 625 (1958).  
    c. The Defendant has disparaged the Plaintiff in front of the minor children, calling her “selfish” and asserting that she “doesn’t really love” them, in violation of the spirit of the May 10, 2022 order and the principle that parents must foster loving relationships with both parents, as emphasized in *Doe v. Doe No. 1*, 421 Mass. 221 (1995).  

7. The Defendant's actions have caused one of the children to exhibit signs of stress and physical symptoms of anxiety, such as recurrent stomachaches on transition days, a change in circumstance that significantly impacts their well-being. This is consistent with *Bak v. Bak*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 608 (1987), which highlights the significance of children’s emotional and physical welfare in custody determinations.  

8. The current custody arrangement is no longer in the best interests of the children, as the Plaintiff’s ability to make decisions and safeguard their emotional security is hindered by the Defendant’s actions in direct conflict with the principles set forth in *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).  

**RELIEF REQUESTED**  
WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  
1. Modify the May 10, 2022 custody order to grant the Plaintiff sole legal custody of the minor children and primary physical custody.  
2. Establish a clear and unambiguous parenting time schedule for the Defendant to follow.  
3. Order that any decisions involving the children’s extracurricular activities, healthcare, and education require written consent of both parents, or absent such agreement, require a Court determination.  
4. Enforce a requirement for both parents to refrain from disparaging the other parent in the presence of the children, consistent with *Gilbert v. Gilbert*, 73 Mass. App. Ct. 256 (2008).  
5. Order such other and further relief as the Court deems just, equitable, and consistent with the best interests of the minor children.  

**LEGAL BASIS**  
This complaint is filed pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, which provides that child custody judgments may be modified upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the best interests of the child. The facts detailed above satisfy this standard, consistent with precedents such as *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006) and *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).  

**NOTICE OF HEARING**  
Plaintiff requests that this matter be scheduled for a hearing before the Bristol County Probate and Family Court at the earliest possible date.  

**Respectfully submitted,**
