**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**CAMBRIDGE DISTRICT COURT**  
_______________________________  
Emily Johnson,  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

Michael Richards,  
Defendant.  
_______________________________  

**Civil Docket No. _______**

**Complaint**  

**I. Parties**  

1. The Plaintiff, **Emily Johnson**, resides at **45 River Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139**.  
2. The Defendant, **Michael Richards**, owns and manages the residential property located at **45 River Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139**, among other properties in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  

**II. Jurisdiction and Venue**  

3. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 97, as Plaintiff seeks monetary damages under state law arising from Defendant’s breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment.  
4. Venue is proper in Cambridge District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 2 and 8, as the Plaintiff resides at the subject property, which is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  

**III. Factual Allegations**  

5. The Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant on **June 15, 2021**, to rent the unit located at **45 River Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139**.  
6. Pursuant to the lease, Plaintiff pays **$1,800 per month** in rent.  
7. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, every residential lease in Massachusetts includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, which guarantees tenants the right to peaceful enjoyment of their rental property without substantial interference by their landlord, anyone acting on the landlord’s behalf, or other circumstances stemming from the landlord’s actions.  
8. Beginning in or around **October 1, 2025**, the Defendant commenced **construction and renovation work** in the unit directly adjoining Plaintiff’s apartment.  
9. The construction generated **substantial and consistent noise**, including drilling, hammering, and loud conversations among workers, occurring during weekdays from approximately **8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.**.  
10. The excessive noise has disrupted Plaintiff’s ability to work from home, causing Plaintiff difficulty in concentrating during work calls and completing her professional duties.  
11. In addition to the noise, **dust and debris** have entered Plaintiff’s apartment through the ventilation system during the course of the construction.  
12. On one or more occasions, Plaintiff notified the Defendant about the disruptive noise and dust and requested relief.  
13. In response, Defendant offered Plaintiff **a one-time rent reduction of $100**, which did not adequately compensate Plaintiff for the significant disruption to her enjoyment of her home.  
14. Defendant’s conduct has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy her rental premises.  
15. The construction has continued for over **two months**, and Defendant has stated that the work may last **another one to two months**.  

**IV. Cause of Action – Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  

16. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 15 of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein.  
17. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord’s actions or omissions that substantially interfere with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of their leased premises constitute a violation of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment.  
18. Under Massachusetts statutory and common law, a landlord may be held liable for interfering with the enjoyment of the premises even if the interference is not malicious or done in bad faith. See *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 284 (1994)*; *Al Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847, 850-51 (1997).  
19. Defendant’s actions, including permitting **prolonged and disruptive construction activities**, caused a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s ability to use her residence in a quiet and peaceful manner, in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14.  
20. Massachusetts courts have held that significant construction noise and related conditions can violate the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See *Jablonski v. Casey*, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744, 747 (2005); *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 102-03 (1982).  
21. Defendant’s failure to adequately mitigate the construction noise and dust also represents negligent management of the property and constitutes “serious interference” as defined by Massachusetts law. See *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714, 717-18 (1977).  
22. Plaintiff is entitled to damages for the harm caused by this interference, including emotional distress, loss of use, and diminution in the value of her tenancy, as recognized in *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 102-03 (1982); G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

**V. Damages**  

23. Plaintiff has suffered monetary and non-monetary harm as a result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, including:  
   a. Disruption to the peaceful use and enjoyment of her home;  
   b. Emotional distress resulting from near-constant noise and dust;  
   c. Interference with her ability to work from home; and  
   d. The diminution of the fair rental value of her unit during the period of disruption.  
24. Plaintiff estimates her damages to be **$3,000**, which reflects three months’ worth of significant disruption to Plaintiff’s tenancy, at a value of $1,000 per month.  

**VI. Prayer for Relief**  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Enter judgment in her favor on her claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;  
2. Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in the amount of $3,000, or such other amount as the Court deems appropriate under the circumstances;  
3. Award Plaintiff her costs and expenses incurred in this action, pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14; and  
4. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and equitable.  

Respectfully submitted,  

Dated: December 1, 2025
