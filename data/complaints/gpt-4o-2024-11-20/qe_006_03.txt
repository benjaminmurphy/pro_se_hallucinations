**BROCKTON DISTRICT COURT**  
**CIVIL ACTION NO. [Leave Blank for Court Use]**

**Jessica Rivera,**  
    Plaintiff,  
v.  
**Mark Thompson,**  
    Defendant.  

**COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**

**PARTIES AND JURISDICTION**  
1. Plaintiff Jessica Rivera (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing at 45 Maple Street, Brockton, Massachusetts, located within the jurisdiction of this Court.  

2. Defendant Mark Thompson (“Defendant”) is the landlord and owner of the residential building located at 45 Maple Street, Brockton, Massachusetts.  

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19, as the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limit of the District Court and the property in question is located in Brockton, Massachusetts.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
4. On June 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant to rent an apartment at 45 Maple Street, Brockton, Massachusetts (the “Premises”), for $1,200 per month.  

5. As part of the lease agreement, Defendant was obligated to maintain the Premises in compliance with state and local housing laws, which include the provision of essential services such as hot water, a requirement under 105 C.M.R. § 410.190 of the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code.  

6. On or about November 10, 2025, the hot water in the Premises became nonfunctional and has not been restored as of the date of this Complaint.  

7. Plaintiff reported the lack of hot water to Defendant on or about November 10, 2025. Defendant initially responded by stating that the water heater required a repair and that a replacement part had been ordered.  

8. Despite repeated follow-ups by Plaintiff, Defendant has failed to restore hot water to the Premises for over three weeks, citing delays in receiving the necessary part.  

9. During this period, Plaintiff has been forced to endure cold showers, boil water for household use, and travel to a gym to shower at additional expense. Plaintiff has also had to take her infant child to another location for baths due to the lack of hot water, causing further inconvenience and expense.  

10. The failure to provide hot water has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises and has effectively rendered the apartment uninhabitable in violation of Massachusetts law.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  
11. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through 10 as if fully set forth herein.  

12. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, every tenant is entitled to the covenant of quiet enjoyment, meaning the right to use and enjoy leased premises free from serious interference by the landlord.  

13. Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment by failing to restore hot water to the Premises within a reasonable time, depriving Plaintiff of the essential function of hot water necessary for daily life and hygiene.  

14. Defendant’s actions, including repeated delays and failure to resolve the issue, constitute an unlawful interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.  

15. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord’s interference with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment can render the landlord liable for actual damages, consequential damages, and/or treble damages where appropriate.  

16. As a result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered damages, including but not limited to:  
   a. Actual damages, including additional expenses for gym showers, transportation, and alternative bathing arrangements, estimated at $100.  
   b. Consequential damages, including emotional distress, inconvenience, and the inability to safely and comfortably inhabit the Premises, estimated at $300.  

17. Plaintiff is entitled to damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but not less than $400, and requests that the Court enter treble damages pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Honorable Court grant the following relief:  
1. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14.  
2. Award Plaintiff actual damages of at least $400 due to Defendant’s failure to restore essential services.  
3. Award Plaintiff treble damages pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14.  
4. Award Plaintiff costs of this action, including reasonable fees where applicable.  
5. Award such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper under the circumstances.  

**JURY DEMAND**  
Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

**Respectfully submitted,**  
Dated: December 1, 2025
