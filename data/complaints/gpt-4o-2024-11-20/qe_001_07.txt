---  

### I. PARTIES  

1. Plaintiff Jasmine Carter is an individual who resides at 123 Ashmont Street, Apartment 2, Dorchester, Massachusetts, where she has rented a residential apartment since March 1, 2022.  
2. Defendant Michael Thompson is the owner and landlord of the apartment building located at 123 Ashmont Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts, including Plaintiff’s unit. Defendant, upon information and belief, conducts business and resides in Massachusetts.  

---  

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE  

3. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to **G.L. c. 218, §§ 19** and other applicable laws as the amount in controversy does not exceed $25,000.  
4. Venue is proper in the Dorchester Division of the Boston Municipal Court because the premises that are the subject of this dispute are located in Dorchester, Massachusetts, and Defendant conducts business there.  

---  

### III. STATEMENT OF FACTS  

5. Plaintiff has rented the property located at 123 Ashmont Street, Apartment 2, Dorchester, MA, from Defendant since March 1, 2022, for a monthly rent of $1,800.  
6. Massachusetts law requires all landlords to maintain residential rental properties in habitable condition, including ensuring adequate heating services during the heating season. See **105 C.M.R. § 410.201**; **Young v. Garwacki**, 380 Mass. 162 (1980).  
7. During the winter of 2024-2025, Plaintiff’s heating system malfunctioned repeatedly, causing the indoor temperature of the apartment to drop to approximately 60 degrees for several hours at a time, typically in the evening.  
8. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the heating issues on multiple occasions. Defendant sent repair personnel to address the issue on two occasions.  
    a. The heating system functioned properly for one week after the first repair visit before the issues resumed.  
    b. On the second visit, the repairperson concluded that the boiler was "old but functional" and informed Plaintiff that little could be done to prevent further interruptions.  
9. Despite these repairs, the heating system’s performance remained inadequate throughout the winter months, requiring Plaintiff to purchase and use two electric space heaters to warm the apartment to livable temperatures.  
10. The use of space heaters increased Plaintiff’s electricity bills by approximately $150 per month for the months of December 2024, January 2025, and February 2025, for a total of $450.  
11. Due to the cold air inside her apartment, Plaintiff suffered bronchitis in January 2025, which required a medical visit, a prescription for antibiotics, and caused Plaintiff to miss three days of work.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  

**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  

12. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in the preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.  
13. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, every residential lease in Massachusetts carries with it an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, which guarantees a tenant’s right to the full use and enjoyment of leased premises without substantial interference caused by the landlord or anyone acting on the landlord’s behalf.  
14. Defendant substantially impaired Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises by failing to provide adequate heat, a condition that violates the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code (**105 C.M.R. § 410.201**) and renders the property unfit for human habitation.  
15. Defendant’s failure to provide consistent and functional heating services constitutes a breach of Plaintiff’s covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law. See **Al-Ziab v. Mourgis**, 424 Mass. 847 (1997).  
16. Defendant’s actions and inactions caused Plaintiff to suffer financial damages, including but not limited to the costs of additional electricity for space heaters, medical expenses related to Plaintiff’s bronchitis, and lost wages due to illness. See **Jablonski v. Casey**, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744 (2005).  
17. Plaintiff is entitled to damages for Defendant’s substantial interference with her right to quiet enjoyment of the premises, as well as for consequential damages related to Defendant’s statutory violations. See **Dolphi Realty Trust v. Board of Health of Sudbury**, 70 Mass. App. Ct. 1 (2007).  

---  

### V. DAMAGES  

18. As a result of Defendant’s actions, Plaintiff has suffered the following damages:  
    a. $450 incurred in excess electricity costs;  
    b. Medical expenses related to Plaintiff’s illness, including the cost of antibiotics ($50);  
    c. Lost wages due to illness ($450);  
    d. Emotional distress and inconvenience caused by Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  

19. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, Plaintiff is entitled to actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, as well as attorney’s fees and costs.  

---  

### VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jasmine Carter respectfully requests that this Court:  

1. Award Plaintiff actual damages in the amount of $1,450 or three times the monthly rent, whichever is greater, pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14**;  
2. Award statutory interest under **G.L. c. 231, § 6B**;  
3. Award Plaintiff's costs associated with this action;  
4. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

---  

### VII. JURY DEMAND  

Plaintiff respectfully demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
