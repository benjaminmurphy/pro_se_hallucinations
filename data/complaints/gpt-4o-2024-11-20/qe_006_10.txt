### BROCKTON DISTRICT COURT  

**Jessica Taylor,**  
Plaintiff,  
v.  
**Mark Stevens,**  
Defendant.  

CIVIL ACTION NO.: [To be assigned by the Court]  

**COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**   

**INTRODUCTION**  
1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Taylor, brings this action against the Defendant, Mark Stevens, for failure to maintain her rental unit in a habitable condition by ensuring the availability of hot water, which constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law.  

**PARTIES AND JURISDICTION**  
2. The Plaintiff, Jessica Taylor, resides at 45 Maple Street, Brockton, MA 02301 (“the Property”) and rents the Property as her primary residence.  
3. The Defendant, Mark Stevens, is the owner and landlord of the Property with a principal place of business or residence in Massachusetts.  
4. This Court has jurisdiction over the matter under M.G.L. c. 231, § 2, and venue is proper because the Property is located in Brockton, Plymouth County, and the events giving rise to this action occurred in Brockton.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
5. On or about January 1, 2022, Plaintiff began renting the Property located at 45 Maple Street, Brockton, MA, pursuant to an oral or written lease agreement with Defendant. Plaintiff pays $1,200 per month in rent.  
6. The covenant of quiet enjoyment, implied by law in all residential leases pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, guarantees tenants the right to live in their rental units free from substantial interference.  
7. On or about November 10, 2025, the hot water in Plaintiff’s rental unit went out entirely, rendering her unable to take hot showers or use hot water for dishwashing or other daily activities.  
8. Plaintiff immediately notified Defendant of this issue via text message, to which Defendant responded the same day, citing the need to repair or replace a defective water heater.  
9. However, as of December 1, 2025, nearly three weeks later, Defendant has failed to restore hot water to the Property despite multiple assurances that the issue was “being worked on.”  
10. During this time, Defendant has explained that the necessary replacement part for the water heater is backordered, but Defendant has not provided a concrete timeline for resolution or offered any alternative means of providing hot water.  
11. As a result of the lack of hot water, Plaintiff has been forced to take cold showers, boil water for dishwashing, travel to a gym and pay $30 per month for membership to access hot showers, and drive additional distances to bathe her infant at her mother’s house.  
12. The lack of hot water has caused Plaintiff significant discomfort, financial losses, and interference with her daily life and ability to enjoy the rental unit.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**Count I: Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (M.G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  
13. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth above as if fully stated herein.  
14. Under M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord breaches the covenant of quiet enjoyment when their actions or omissions result in a substantial interference with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of their rental premises.  
15. The lack of hot water for nearly three weeks constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Property. See *Lashley v. Bryant*, 7 Mass. App. Ct. 826 (1979).   
16. Defendant’s failure to take adequate steps to promptly restore hot water constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law. *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847, 851 (1997).  
17. This breach entitles Plaintiff to recover damages, including rent abatements, incidental expenses, and statutory remedies. See *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994) (interpreting M.G.L. c. 186, § 14 as a remedy for interference with tenant rights).  

**VIOLATIONS OF LAW AND SUPPORTING CASES**  
18. Massachusetts law imposes a legal obligation on landlords to maintain habitable rental premises, including through the implied warranty of habitability. See *Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184 (1973).  
19. The inability to access hot water for daily needs constitutes a serious breach of habitability standards, for which Plaintiff may recover damages. See *Ducey v. Doherty*, 459 Mass. 222, 229 (2011).  
20. Defendant’s failure to adequately address the loss of hot water, even after being notified multiple times, is an actionable breach under M.G.L. c. 186, § 14. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 100 (1982).  
21. Plaintiff is entitled to damages for the unnecessary expenses incurred and for the diminution in value of her rental unit during the period of interference. See *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196, 199 (1979).  
22. Defendant’s continued delay violates the reasonable expectations of a tenant regarding habitable living conditions. See *Young v. Patukonis*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907, 910 (1987).  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grant the following relief:  
1. Award Plaintiff damages for the breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, including but not limited to:  
   a. A rent abatement in the amount of $400 for the period during which Plaintiff did not have hot water;  
   b. Reimbursement of $30 for Plaintiff’s gym membership expenses and reasonable costs associated with driving to access hot water;  
   c. Compensation for the inconvenience and interference caused by the lack of hot water.  
2. Grant Plaintiff’s attorneys' fees and costs as permitted by M.G.L. c. 186, § 14.  
3. Order any other relief the Court deems just and equitable.  

Respectfully submitted,  

DATED: December 1, 2025
