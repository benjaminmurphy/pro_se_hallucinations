Nowhere does the court discuss tort duties, negligence standards, or custodial obligations to children.

It does not discuss childcare providers, custodial care relationships, or a general duty of reasonable care owed by such providers.

Zaher, 344 Mass. 590, 592 (1962). ... The second factual question is whether the parents exercised reasonable care to prevent Michael from driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor."

Emerson College (actually a criminal procedure case concerning an automobile stop and search) does not address negligence, supervision of children, or foreseeability of injuries to children. Its analysis is limited to Fourth Amendment/Article 14 issues about exit orders, patfrisks, and the permissible scope of protective searches during traffic stops. It therefore cannot be cited as authority for the proposition that injuries to children are a foreseeable consequence of a failure to provide reasonable supervision.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe question, though, is whether, notwithstanding the justification for the search at its inception, it became excessive in its scope once no weapon was found during the patfrisk or in the immediate area where the defendant had been seated. \u2018\u201cIt is settled in law that, in appropriate circumstances, a Terry type of search may extend into the interior of an automobile so long as it is limited in scope to a protective end.\u201d\u2019 \u2026 What these cases demonstrate is that the scope of a protective search within the interior of an automobile must be limited by, and rationally connected to, a safety concern about the particular area to be searched.\u201d"
