Therefore it provides no authority for the proposition that mold from bathroom ventilation issues constitutes a serious and unreasonable interference with the tenant\u2019s use and enjoyment of the premises.",

For example: \u201cWe must decide whether, by taking a single appeal from two decisions of the assessors concerning similar and contiguous parcels, the taxpayer committed a procedural error sufficient to deprive the board of jurisdiction to decide any or all of the three appeals.\u201d This does not relate to mold, ventilation, or interference with use and enjoyment of premises."

The inspector found that virtually all of the defects identified by the judge remained unrepaired....

However, the opinion does not characterize the conduct as a \u2018constructive eviction,\u2019 nor does it hold that such blame-shifting and refusal to address conditions, by themselves, amount to constructive eviction.

However, it does not involve or discuss a tenant-defendant, \"blame-shifting,\" or a defendant\u2019s refusal to address conditions; instead, it concerns landlords\u2019 liability and tenants successfully asserting constructive eviction as a defense to rent. Thus, it supports the general constructive-eviction principle, but not the specific proposition as framed about a defendant\u2019s conduct.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "There are occasions, however, where a landlord has not intended to violate a tenant\u2019s rights, but there was nevertheless a breach of the landlord\u2019s covenant of quiet enjoyment which flowed as the natural and probable consequence of what the landlord did, what he failed to do, or what he permitted to be done... Because the disturbing condition was the natural and probable consequence of the landlords\u2019 permitting the lounge to operate where it did and because the landlords could control the actions at the lounge, they should not be entitled to collect rent for residential premises which were not reasonably habitable."
