**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**CAMBRIDGE DISTRICT COURT**  
**MIDDLESEX COUNTY**  

**Liam Johnson**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**Marissa Kent**  
Defendant.  

**CIVIL ACTION NO. __________**  

**COMPLAINT**  

**INTRODUCTION**  

Plaintiff Liam Johnson (“Plaintiff”), by and through himself, brings this action against Defendant Marissa Kent (“Defendant”) for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law. Plaintiff rented an apartment located at 154 Fresh Pond Parkway, Cambridge, MA 02138, and Defendant’s actions or inactions have substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s right to peacefully use and enjoy the premises.  

Plaintiff seeks damages and any other relief the Court deems appropriate.  

**PARTIES**  

1. Plaintiff Liam Johnson is a natural person residing at 154 Fresh Pond Parkway, Unit #3, Cambridge, MA 02138.  
2. Defendant Marissa Kent is the owner and landlord of 154 Fresh Pond Parkway, Cambridge, MA 02138. Upon information and belief, she resides in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19, as this claim falls within the scope of claims properly brought in the District Court.  
4. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1, as the apartment at issue is located in Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

5. Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a written lease agreement, whereby Plaintiff rented a residential apartment located at 154 Fresh Pond Parkway, Unit #3, Cambridge, MA 02138, beginning on or about June 1, 2022.  
6. Plaintiff pays $2,200 per month in rent pursuant to the lease agreement.  
7. The lease agreement incorporates the covenant of quiet enjoyment as codified in G.L. c. 186, § 14, which guarantees Plaintiff the right to reasonably use and enjoy the rental premises without substantial interference by the landlord.  
8. Beginning in or around October 2025, Defendant caused or allowed ongoing renovation work on the unit adjacent to Plaintiff’s apartment.  
9. The construction work includes drilling, hammering, and other noise-producing activity occurring on weekdays from approximately 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM.  
10. The noise from the construction work has been excessive and disruptive, preventing Plaintiff from concentrating during work hours, as Plaintiff works from home.  
11. Additionally, construction dust has entered Plaintiff’s apartment through the ventilation system, further disrupting Plaintiff’s use of the property and creating an unhealthy living environment.  
12. The construction work and disturbances have persisted for over two months, with no definitive end date communicated by Defendant.  
13. The disturbances substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy the apartment, thereby breaching the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14.  
14. Although Defendant offered Plaintiff a token rent reduction of $100 for one month, the minimal rent reduction is insufficient to compensate for the disruptions and damages suffered by Plaintiff.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  

**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  

15. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through 14 of this Complaint.  
16. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, every lease or rental agreement is subject to the covenant of quiet enjoyment, which protects tenants from substantial interference by landlords or their agents with the tenant’s lawful use and enjoyment of the leased premises.  
17. A landlord’s substantial interference with a tenant’s enjoyment of the premises constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 102 (1982).  
18. Defendant’s actions and omissions, including but not limited to unreasonably excessive construction noise and dust entering Plaintiff’s unit, constitute substantial interferences with Plaintiff’s ability to reasonably use and enjoy the premises.  
19. Defendant’s failure to take adequate measures to prevent or mitigate these disturbances caused Plaintiff significant harm, frustration, and inconvenience, and deprived Plaintiff of the full benefit of the leased premises.  
20. Defendant’s actions constitute a violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14 and Massachusetts common law. See *Cruz Mgmt. Co. v. Thomas*, 417 Mass. 782, 789 (1994) (noting that “a substantial interference with the enjoyment of the premises may constitute a breach of quiet enjoyment”); *Doe v. New Bedford Housing Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273, 285 (1994) (explaining that breaches of quiet enjoyment occur when a landlord’s conduct or failure to act interrupts a tenant’s ability to enjoy leased space).  

**DAMAGES**  

21. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord who breaches the covenant of quiet enjoyment is liable for actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater.  
22. As a result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered significant disruption to his daily life and work, as well as emotional distress.  
23. Plaintiff has incurred monetary damages, including lost productivity and diminished value of the rental premises, estimated at $600.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in Plaintiff’s favor, and that the Court:  

1. Award Plaintiff actual damages of no less than $600, or three months’ rent ($6,600), whichever is greater, pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14;  
2. Award additional damages for emotional distress and diminution of the rental value of the premises;  
3. Award Plaintiff his costs in filing and pursuing this action; and  
4. Grant such further and other relief as the Court deems just and proper.  

**JURY DEMAND**  

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury as to all issues so triable pursuant to Rule 38 of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure.  

Respectfully Submitted,  
Plaintiff,  
Liam Johnson
