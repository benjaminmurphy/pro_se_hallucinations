Plaintiff,  

v.  

**Michael Brown,**  
Defendant.  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**  

**NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Taylor, and respectfully states as follows:**  

---

### **INTRODUCTION**  

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Taylor, brings this Complaint for Modification of the existing Custody Order, dated May 15, 2021, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws ch. 208, § 28 and related family law statutes and precedents.  
 
2. The Plaintiff requests that this Court modify the custody order by imposing supervised visitation or additional conditions to ensure the welfare and safety of the parties’ minor child, Ethan Brown, born on March 22, 2017.  

3. A material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the original custody order that impacts the best interests of the minor child.

### **FACTUAL BACKGROUND**  

4. The parties share one minor child, Ethan Brown, age 8.  

5. The original custody order, dated May 15, 2021, granted the parties shared legal custody, with physical custody of Ethan primarily with the Plaintiff and visitation with the Defendant on specified weekends.  

6. At the time of the original order, the Court found that both parents were stable, capable, and able to co-parent effectively in the best interests of the child.  

7. Since the entry of that order, the circumstances have changed materially, raising serious concerns about Ethan’s safety and well-being while in the care of the Defendant.  

8. Ethan frequently returns from visits with the Defendant in a state of exhaustion. His school has reported that Ethan regularly appears tired on Monday mornings, which interferes with his ability to focus and perform well academically.  

9. Recently, Ethan disclosed to the Plaintiff that there are “special drinks” at the Defendant’s residence and that the Defendant “can’t walk straight” at times.  

10. A neighbor of the Defendant provided the Plaintiff with video evidence showing the Defendant intoxicated and stumbling while getting Ethan out of a vehicle late at night, raising significant concerns about impaired parenting and Ethan’s safety.  

11. Upon information and belief, the Defendant’s behavior demonstrates a recurring pattern of alcohol misuse during Ethan’s visitation periods that creates an unsafe environment for the minor child.  

12. The Plaintiff has exercised her best efforts to communicate her concerns with the Defendant, to no avail.  

13. The Plaintiff now seeks a modification of the custody order to protect Ethan’s well-being, as his best interests are no longer being met under the current arrangement.

### **LEGAL GROUNDS FOR MODIFICATION**  

14. A custody order may be modified pursuant to M.G.L. ch. 208, § 28 if there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior order and such modification is necessary to protect the child’s best interests.  

15. The safety, health, and welfare of the minor child are the paramount considerations in any custody determination. **Bezio v. Patenaude**, 381 Mass. 563, 577 (1980).  

16. The Defendant’s alleged misuse of alcohol while in the presence of the minor child constitutes a material change in circumstances that poses a potential risk to Ethan’s safety and directly impacts his best interests. **Hunter v. Rose**, 463 Mass. 488, 496-97 (2012).  

17. Courts may impose supervised visitation or other safeguards to protect children in custody arrangements when one parent’s actions threaten their safety. See **Custody of Vaughn**, 422 Mass. 590, 596 (1996); **Custody of Zia**, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 237, 244 (2000).  

18. Pursuant to **Mason v. Coleman**, 447 Mass. 177, 186 (2006), the Court has broad discretion to impose conditions necessary to protect a child’s physical and emotional well-being during custody or visitation periods.  

19. Massachusetts law recognizes a court’s authority to modify custodial terms proactively when reasonable evidence suggests that parental conduct endangers the child, even absent direct physical harm. See **Hodgkins v. Hodgkins**, 27 Mass. App. Ct. 133, 135 (1989).  

20. The Defendant’s alleged consistent intoxication while caring for Ethan interferes with the proper discharge of parental responsibilities and puts Ethan at risk of harm. See **Bak v. Bak**, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 608, 616-17 (1987).  

21. Modification of the custody order is necessary to serve the best interests of the child, as emphasized under **G.L. ch. 208, § 31** and reaffirmed in **Gilmore v. Gilmore**, 369 Mass. 598, 605 (1976).  

22. The requested relief is appropriate given the material change in circumstances and aligns with the principle that visitation must not compromise the child’s safety. See **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas**, 395 Mass. 704, 711 (1985).

### **REQUESTED RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Taylor, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the original custody order on May 15, 2021.  

2. Modify the existing custody order to include one or more of the following:  
   a. Supervised visitation between the Defendant, Michael Brown, and the minor child, Ethan Brown;  
   b. A prohibition on the consumption of alcohol or other intoxicating substances by the Defendant during or immediately preceding visitation periods;  
   c. Any other conditions the Court deems necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of the minor child.  

3. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
