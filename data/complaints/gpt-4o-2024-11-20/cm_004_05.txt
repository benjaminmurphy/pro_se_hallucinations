NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, in the above-captioned matter, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws (M.G.L.) Chapter 208, Section 28, and related authority, to modify the current custody and parenting time order concerning the parties’ minor child, Lucas Smith. In support of this Complaint, the Plaintiff states as follows:  

---

### **1. Parties**  

1.1. The Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, resides at [Your Home Address], in [City], Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff is the mother of the minor child, Lucas Smith.  

1.2. The Defendant, Michael Smith, resides at [Defendant’s Current Address], in [City], Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Defendant is the father of the minor child, Lucas Smith.

### **2. Jurisdiction**  

2.1. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to M.G.L. c. 208, § 28, M.G.L. c. 209C, § 20, and all other applicable statutes.  

2.2. Both Plaintiff and Defendant reside within the jurisdiction of Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and the minor child resides with Plaintiff in Middlesex County.  

---

### **3. Factual Allegations**  

3.1. Pursuant to the custody and parenting time order entered by this Court on April 15, 2018, Plaintiff was granted primary physical custody of the minor child, Lucas Smith, who is now eight years old, while Defendant was awarded three short mid-week visits and one Sunday afternoon visit per week, with no overnight parenting time.  

3.2. At the time of the original custody determination, Defendant resided in a shared apartment with roommates and did not have appropriate housing to accommodate overnight visits with the minor child.  

3.3. Circumstances have materially changed since the original custody order was entered. Specifically:  

  a. Defendant has secured stable and independent housing, including a two-bedroom apartment, where the minor child now has his own dedicated bedroom.  

  b. The minor child, Lucas Smith, is now eight years old and enrolled in school full-time, with significant changes in his developmental and social needs compared to when the original order was entered.  

  c. The current parenting schedule, which requires multiple short visits during the week, disrupts Lucas’ school and home life, creating difficulties in establishing a consistent homework and bedtime routine.  

  d. The minor child has expressed a desire for overnight visits with Defendant, and both Plaintiff and Defendant agree that a revised parenting schedule is in the child’s best interest.  

3.4. The Plaintiff and Defendant recognize the need to modify the parenting schedule to reflect the material changes in the child’s circumstances and to promote his best interests.

### **4. Legal Standards and Applicable Law**  

4.1. Massachusetts courts, under M.G.L. c. 208, § 28, and case law such as *Charara v. Yatim*, 78 Mass. App. Ct. 325 (2010), recognize the Court's authority to modify custody and parenting time orders upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and where modification is in the best interests of the child.  

4.2. The best interests of the child are the paramount consideration in all custody and parenting time matters (see *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488, 494 (2012); *Rollins v. Rollins*, 55 Mass. App. Ct. 407, 412-13 (2002)).  

4.3. The establishment of the child’s stability and routine is critical to determining the child’s best interests (see *Hale v. Hale*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 812, 816 (1981)).  

4.4. Massachusetts courts further recognize that age-appropriate parenting schedules and strong parental relationships with both parents are generally in a child’s best interests (see *Johnson v. Lewis*, 80 Mass. App. Ct. 1114 (2011); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 186 (2006)).  

4.5. *Beals v. Beals*, 601 Mass. 540 (2006), emphasizes the need for the parenting schedule to evolve as the developmental needs of the child change over time.  

4.6. The material change in the Defendant’s housing stability and the minor child’s new stage of life are compelling reasons for the Court to revise the current order in favor of a schedule that allows for overnight visits with Defendant.

### **5. Requested Relief**  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

5.1. Find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the custody and parenting order dated April 15, 2018.  

5.2. Modify the existing custody and parenting time order to reflect a parenting schedule that includes a minimum of every-other-weekend overnight parenting time for Defendant, in addition to an appropriate schedule for holidays, summer vacations, and school vacations, to promote the best interests of the minor child, Lucas Smith.  

5.3. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
