McCaul concerns Medicaid eligibility and whether assets in an irrevocable trust are countable resources; it does not address landlord-tenant law, quiet enjoyment, or maintenance issues in a rental context. The pages provided (including page 443) focus entirely on trust structure and MassHealth regulations. Thus, this case does not support the proposition about a tenant\u2019s right to fully use and enjoy their home or a landlord\u2019s breach of quiet enjoyment for failure to maintain the premises.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"Finally, we take this opportunity to stress that we have no doubt that self-settled, irrevocable trusts may, if so structured, so insulate trust assets that those assets will be deemed unavailable to the settlor. ... In our view, Muriel\u2019s trust, as structured, allows the trustees a degree of discretionary authority that would, if sanctioned, permit Muriel to enjoy her assets, preserve those assets for her heirs, and receive public assistance, to, in effect, \u2018have [her] cake and eat it too.\u2019\""
