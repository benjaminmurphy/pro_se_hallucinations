v.  

**Laura Smith,**  
*Defendant.*  

CIVIL DOCKET NO: ________________  

### COMPLAINT  

**NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jordan Williams ("Plaintiff"), and complains against Defendant, Laura Smith ("Defendant"), and alleges as follows:**  

---

### I. PARTIES  

1. The Plaintiff, Jordan Williams, is a residential tenant who resides in a basement apartment located at **45 Elm Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119**.  
2. The Defendant, Laura Smith, is the Plaintiff’s landlord and owns the rental property at the above address.  

---

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE  

3. This Complaint is properly before the Boston Municipal Court, Roxbury Division, pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, § 3, because it concerns a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment related to rental housing located in Roxbury, Massachusetts.  
4. Venue is proper in this Court under G.L. c. 223, §§ 1 and 8, as the acts and omissions giving rise to Plaintiff’s claims occurred in Roxbury, Massachusetts.  

---

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

5. On March 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential lease agreement with Defendant to rent a basement apartment located at 45 Elm Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts (the "Premises"), for $1,200 per month.  
6. Plaintiff has paid monthly rent as required, with the exception of October 2025, when rent was paid two weeks late along with the agreed-upon late fee.  
7. In November 2025, Plaintiff noticed water seeping into the Premises through the basement wall during heavy rain.  
8. On or around November 10, 2025, Plaintiff notified Defendant of the water intrusion via text message. Defendant responded that she would "look into it" but took no further action.  
9. When the water intrusion continued unabated, Plaintiff called local housing authorities, who conducted an inspection of the Premises and found violations of the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, including, but not limited to, the water intrusion issue.  
10. Defendant has not remedied the water intrusion, and the condition persists as of the date of this filing.  
11. As a direct result of Defendant’s failure to address the water intrusion, Plaintiff has suffered damage to personal property, including a rug and a bookshelf, with a total estimated value of approximately $400.  
12. Plaintiff has been required to run a dehumidifier continuously to mitigate the water intrusion, resulting in increased utility costs.  
13. On or about November 30, 2025, Defendant informed Plaintiff that she would not renew Plaintiff’s lease when it expires in March 2026. Defendant stated this was due to Plaintiff’s late rent in October 2025; however, Plaintiff believes this decision was made in retaliation for complaining about the water intrusion and calling housing authorities, in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 18.

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION – BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT  

14. Plaintiff repeats and reasserts the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1–13 as if fully set forth herein.  
15. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord has an obligation to provide their tenant with the quiet enjoyment of their rental property, as guaranteed by **G.L. c. 186, § 14**.  
16. The covenant of quiet enjoyment prohibits a landlord from interfering with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the rental unit, including through their actions or omissions.  
17. Defendant has breached Plaintiff’s covenant of quiet enjoyment by:  
   a. Failing to remedy the persistent water intrusion in the Premises;  
   b. Failing to repair violations of the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code;  
   c. Retaliating against Plaintiff by refusing to renew Plaintiff’s lease after Plaintiff reported the water intrusion to housing authorities.  
18. Defendant’s actions and omissions have substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises and have caused Plaintiff to suffer damages, including:  
   a. Damage to personal property in the amount of approximately $400;  
   b. Increased utility costs;  
   c. Emotional distress caused by the unsanitary and unsafe living conditions;  
   d. Further inconvenience and disruption associated with Defendant’s retaliatory actions.  
19. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, Defendant is liable for actual damages and, because Defendant’s conduct was willful, liable for treble damages and reasonable attorneys’ fees.

### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in Plaintiff’s favor and award the following relief:  

1. Treble damages pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, for Plaintiff’s actual damages, totaling approximately $400 in property damage, as well as additional monetary damages related to increased utility costs and emotional distress, in an amount to be determined at trial;  
2. Attorneys’ fees and the costs of this litigation pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14;  
3. Injunctive relief requiring Defendant to remedy the water intrusion pursuant to G.L. c. 111, § 127L;  
4. Any other relief this Court deems just and proper.
