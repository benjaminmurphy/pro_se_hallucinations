**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY**  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Martinez, and respectfully submits this Complaint for Modification of Custody pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, on the basis of a material change in circumstances that impacts the best interests of the child, Ethan Thompson. In support of her Complaint, Plaintiff states as follows:  

### PARTIES  

1. **Plaintiff:** Jessica Martinez ("Plaintiff") is the mother of Ethan Thompson, a minor child aged 8, and currently resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts.  
2. **Defendant:** Michael Thompson ("Defendant") is the father of Ethan Thompson and also resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts.  

### JURISDICTION AND VENUE  

3. This matter is properly before the Bristol County Probate and Family Court as the original custody order was issued by this Court on September 15, 2021, and the child resides primarily within the jurisdiction of this Court.  

### FACTUAL BACKGROUND  

4. On or about September 15, 2021, this Court issued a custody order providing for shared legal custody of Ethan Thompson, with primary physical custody awarded to Plaintiff and regular visitation granted to Defendant on weekends.  

5. At the time of the original custody order, the Court found that both parties were stable and capable of co-parenting in a manner that served the best interests of Ethan.  

6. Since the entry of the original custody order, circumstances have materially changed, necessitating modification of the current arrangement to ensure the ongoing safety and well-being of Ethan.  

7. Specifically:  
   a. Ethan has recently disclosed to Plaintiff that there are "special drinks" at Defendant’s residence and that, at times, Defendant "can't walk straight."  
   b. Plaintiff received a video from a concerned neighbor, which depicts Defendant stumbling while retrieving Ethan from a vehicle late at night. This video strongly suggests impaired behavior on the part of Defendant.  
   c. Ethan’s school has commented that he frequently appears unusually exhausted on Monday mornings, which coincides with his weekends spent in Defendant’s care.  

8. These concerns represent a material change in circumstances and provide substantial evidence that Defendant is engaging in behavior that may endanger the physical and emotional well-being of Ethan.  

9. Plaintiff is requesting a modification of the current custody arrangement to ensure that Ethan is protected from potential harm and that his best interests remain paramount.  

### REQUEST FOR MODIFICATION  

10. Plaintiff respectfully requests that the custody order entered on September 15, 2021, be modified to provide as follows:  
   a. Defendant’s visitation with Ethan be supervised by a neutral third party until such time as Defendant demonstrates the ability to maintain sobriety and provide a safe environment for the child.  
   b. In the alternative, Defendant’s visitation be subject to appropriate conditions, including but not limited to:  
      i. Abstention from alcohol or any intoxicating substance during and immediately prior to visitation;  
      ii. Proof of attendance at an alcohol or substance abuse counseling program; and  
      iii. Any other orders the Court deems necessary to protect the best interests of the child.  

11. Plaintiff brings this Complaint for Modification in good faith and in accordance with the principles governing Massachusetts family law, which place paramount importance on the child’s best interests. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).  

### APPLICABLE LAW  

12. The Massachusetts Probate and Family Court is guided by the fundamental principle that all custody arrangements must serve the best interests of the child. G.L. c. 208, § 31.  

13. A parent seeking modification of a custody order must demonstrate a material change in circumstances and that such modification is necessary to promote the child’s best interests. G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012).  

14. The Court has the discretion to require supervised visitation or impose conditions when unsupervised visitation poses a risk to the child’s safety or well-being. See *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540 (2010); *Guardianship of Estelle*, 70 Mass. App. Ct. 575 (2007).  

15. Evidence of parental substance abuse or intoxication is a valid basis for modifying custody or visitation orders to protect the welfare of the child. See *Blixt v. Blixt*, 437 Mass. 649 (2002); *Pizzino v. Miller*, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006).  

16. Courts may consider the observations and testimonies of third parties, including neighbors and school personnel, as credible evidence of circumstances that negatively impact a child’s environment. See *Adoption of Rhona*, 57 Mass. App. Ct. 479 (2003); *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219 (1998).  

17. Plaintiff’s concerns about Defendant’s potential substance abuse align with the principle that custody and visitation arrangements should ensure a stable and healthy environment for the child. See *Custody of Zia*, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 237 (2000).  

18. Ethan’s exhaustion on Mondays raises concerns about his physical and emotional health, which the Massachusetts courts have recognized as critical factors in determining custody arrangements. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).  

### PRAYER FOR RELIEF  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Jessica Martinez, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Find that there has been a material change in circumstances since the entry of the original custody order on September 15, 2021;  
2. Modify the current custody order to require supervised visitation or impose other conditions necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of Ethan Thompson;  
3. Order Defendant to abstain from the use of alcohol or any intoxicating substances during and before visitation with Ethan;  
4. Order Defendant to participate in an alcohol or substance abuse counseling program and provide proof of compliance to the Court;  
5. Award Plaintiff such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.  

Respectfully submitted,
