**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**WORCESTER DISTRICT COURT**  
**CIVIL ACTION NO. [INSERT DOCKET NUMBER UPON FILING]**

**Jordan Miller,**  
Plaintiff,  
v.  
**Harold Finch,**  
Defendant.  

**COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**  

**INTRODUCTION**  

1. This is a civil action under Massachusetts landlord-tenant law for breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment arising out of the Defendant’s failure to address a persistent rodent infestation in the Plaintiff’s rental apartment, which has materially interfered with the Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises. Plaintiff seeks damages, attorneys' fees, and such further relief as the Court may deem appropriate.  

**PARTIES**  

2. The Plaintiff, Jordan Miller, is a resident of Worcester, Massachusetts, residing at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01604.  

3. The Defendant, Harold Finch, is the owner and landlord of the residential property located at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01604, and resides or does business at [INSERT ADDRESS IF KNOWN].  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 97, as this is a civil case brought in District Court for a claim not exceeding $50,000.  

5. Venue is proper in Worcester District Court under G.L. c. 223, § 1, as the property at issue is located in Worcester, and the Defendant conducts business there.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

6. Plaintiff entered into a written lease with Defendant for the residential premises located at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, MA, on or about August 1, 2022, with monthly rent of $1,300.  

7. Since approximately September 1, 2025, Plaintiff has experienced a rodent infestation in the premises, evidenced by the frequent presence of mouse droppings in the kitchen area and other parts of the apartment.  

8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the infestation and requested that Defendant take appropriate measures to address the issue.  

9. In response, Defendant placed a few traps in the premises. These measures were insufficient to abate the infestation, as Plaintiff continued to encounter mouse droppings regularly.  

10. On or about October 1, 2025, Defendant hired an exterminator to visit the premises; however, this was a single visit, and Defendant declined to implement the exterminator’s recommendation to undertake more comprehensive treatment to resolve the infestation.  

11. Defendant also stated that additional pest control measures would be "too expensive" and that rodent activity is "normal for older buildings," despite Plaintiff’s repeated complaints and requests for remediation.  

12. The ongoing rodent infestation has forced Plaintiff to discard approximately $200 worth of contaminated food and spend approximately $80 on mouse-proof storage containers to prevent further contamination.  

13. Plaintiff has experienced significant distress, anxiety, and inconvenience as a result of being unable to use their kitchen for cooking or eating without fear of contamination, thereby interfering with Plaintiff’s ability to peacefully enjoy the premises.  

14. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, the covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied by law in every residential lease and ensures a tenant's right to the full use and enjoyment of their leased premises without substantial interference by the landlord.  

15. Defendant's failure to take adequate measures to remediate the rodent infestation constitutes a violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, as recognized under Massachusetts law.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  

**Count I – Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  

16. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through 15 as though fully set forth herein.  

17. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Defendant’s failure to take reasonable and sufficient measures to address the rodent infestation is a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises, in breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment.  

18. Defendant’s actions and inactions have deprived Plaintiff of the quiet enjoyment of the premises, causing Plaintiff to suffer monetary losses, distress, and overall diminished use of the premises.  

19. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord who breaches the covenant of quiet enjoyment may be held liable to the tenant for actual and consequential damages, and for punitive damages if the violations are found to be willful or egregious.  

20. Defendant’s failure to address the infestation in a meaningful way, despite repeated notice from Plaintiff, was willful, egregious, and in reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s health and well-being.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jordan Miller respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in Plaintiff’s favor and grant the following relief:  

1. An award of actual damages in the amount of at least $280 for monetary losses arising from the infestation, or such other amount proven at trial;  
2. Statutory damages and punitive damages pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14;  
3. Costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14;  
4. Prejudgment and post-judgment interest as permitted by law; and  
5. Such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.  

**JURY DEMAND**  

Plaintiff respectfully demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

**Respectfully submitted,**
