v.  
**Tom Collins,**  
Defendant.

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

**INTRODUCTION**  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Rebecca Collins, and respectfully petitions the Bristol County Probate and Family Court for a modification of the existing custody and parenting time order entered on November 15, 2019. Plaintiff asserts that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances warranting a modification of said order in the best interests of the parties’ minor child, Max Collins.  

**PARTIES**  

1. Plaintiff, Rebecca Collins, resides at [Plaintiff’s Address in Bristol County, MA]. She is the mother of Max Collins, born [Max’s Date of Birth].  
2. Defendant, Tom Collins, resides at [Defendant’s Address in Bristol County, MA]. He is the father of Max Collins.  

**JURISDICTION**  

3. The Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, as this concerns an action to modify parenting time and custody arrangements for a minor child of the parties.  
4. This action is properly filed in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court as the original judgment was entered here, and the parties and minor child reside within the county.  

**FACTUAL BACKGROUND**  

5. On November 15, 2019, the Court issued an Order establishing primary physical custody with Plaintiff and providing a parenting time schedule whereby Defendant is entitled to three short visits during the weekdays and an additional Sunday afternoon visit each week, with no overnights. This Order was appropriate at the time based on the circumstances of the parties and child.  
6. Since the entry of the original Order, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances, as outlined below:  
   a. At the time of the original Order, Defendant resided in a shared apartment with roommates and had no private living space or bedroom for the minor child. Defendant now resides in his own apartment, which features appropriate accommodations, including a dedicated bedroom for Max.  
   b. Max Collins is no longer a toddler. He is now eight years old and enrolled in school full time.  
   c. The current parenting schedule, with multiple short visits during the weekdays, disrupts Max’s homework routine, bedtime schedule, and ability to maintain consistency in his daily life. School responsibilities have increased substantially and are negatively impacted by the frequent disruptions.  
   d. Max has expressed a clear and consistent desire to spend overnight parenting time with Defendant to strengthen his relationship with his father. It is in his best interests to have a consistent and age-appropriate parenting schedule.  
7. Both parties agree that the current schedule is no longer workable and must be modified to better reflect the best interests of the minor child.  

**LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION**  

8. A modification of the custody and parenting plan is warranted under Massachusetts law because the circumstances of the parties and the needs of Max Collins have substantially and materially changed since the entry of the prior judgment. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).  
9. Modifications to custody orders must be based on the “best interests of the child” standard as emphasized in *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985). Here, modifying the parenting schedule to allow for overnight visits with Defendant serves Max’s best interests by fostering a stronger parental bond and reducing the disruptions caused by frequent short visits.  
10. Defendant’s improved living circumstances qualify as a material change warranting modification. See *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012).  
11. The age and developmental stage of Max Collins is another critical factor justifying modification. See *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981) (considering a child’s developmental stage and growing needs in parenting schedules).  
12. Frequent transitions between parents can disrupt a child’s sense of stability and academic performance, which the Court has previously recognized as a basis for modifying visitation schedules. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).  
13. The parties’ mutual agreement that the current schedule does not meet Max’s needs should factor into this Court’s decision. See *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540 (2010).  

**REQUEST FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Rebecca Collins, respectfully requests that the Court enter an Order modifying the existing custody and parenting schedule as follows:  

1. Granting Defendant, Tom Collins, parenting time with the minor child that includes regular overnight visits;  
2. Establishing a new parenting plan that reduces frequent transitions during the school week and provides more consistent and age-appropriate parenting time for Max Collins; and  
3. Ordering such other and further relief as is just and proper.

I, Rebecca Collins, affirm under the penalty of perjury that the facts stated in this Complaint for Modification are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.  

Respectfully submitted,
