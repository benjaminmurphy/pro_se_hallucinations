DOCKET NO.: __________________  

**LAURA MITCHELL,**    
*Plaintiff,*  
v.  
**JAMES CARTER,**  
*Defendant.*  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**  

**INTRODUCTION**  
NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Laura Mitchell, in the above-captioned matter, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, and respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the existing custody order regarding the minor child, Sophie Carter, for the reasons and circumstances set forth below.  

**FACTUAL BACKGROUND**  
1. The Plaintiff, Laura Mitchell, resides in [City/Town], Massachusetts, and is Sophie Carter's mother and primary custodial parent under the existing custody order.  

2. The Defendant, James Carter, resides in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and is Sophie Carter's father.  

3. The parties share one minor child, Sophie Carter, born [DOB].  

4. On October 15, 2019, the Barnstable Probate and Family Court entered a custody order granting primary custody to the Plaintiff, with parenting time awarded to the Defendant every other weekend and one midweek overnight on Wednesdays.  

5. At the time the custody order was entered in 2019, both parties resided in the same town, and the midweek overnight arrangement did not create a significant hardship for the child.  

6. Since the entry of the original custody order, the Defendant has moved approximately ninety (90) miles away to Cape Cod, Massachusetts.  

7. Despite this relocation, the Defendant continues to exercise the midweek overnight on Wednesdays. The Defendant picks Sophie up from school on Wednesdays, drives her to his home in Cape Cod, and then returns her to school early Thursday morning, requiring Sophie to be woken up around 4:30 a.m. to make the ninety-mile drive back to her school.  

8. As a direct result of this arrangement, Sophie experiences significant exhaustion on Thursdays, which has negatively impacted her academic performance and ability to participate in school. Sophie's teacher has reported that her engagement and class participation noticeably decline on Thursdays.  

9. The remainder of the custody schedule, which includes the Defendant's parenting time on alternating weekends, has also become increasingly burdensome due to the extended drives and their impact on Sophie's well-being.  

10. The facts described above represent a substantial and material change in circumstances that render the existing custody arrangement no longer in Sophie's best interests.  

**RELIEF REQUESTED**  
WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grant the following relief:  

A. Modify the existing custody order to eliminate the midweek overnight on Wednesdays, ensuring that Sophie can maintain a consistent school routine and receive the rest necessary for her academic and emotional well-being;  

B. Adjust the weekend parenting time schedule as deemed appropriate by the Court to minimize the burden of the long drives on the minor child;  

C. Award such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

**LEGAL GROUNDS**  
11. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, a custody order may be modified by the Court upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and a determination that such modification is in the child's best interests.  

12. Numerous appellate decisions affirm that the primary consideration in modifying custody arrangements is the best interests of the child. See, e.g., *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).  

13. Massachusetts law recognizes that custody orders must be modified where circumstances have made the existing arrangement detrimental to the child. See *Pierce v. Pierce*, 455 Mass. 286 (2009).  

14. A relocation by one parent that impacts the child's access to school or stability constitutes a material change in circumstances. See *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).  

15. The exhaustion and academic difficulties Sophie has suffered as a result of the current midweek schedule raise serious concerns about her well-being, making modification necessary pursuant to *Esther v. Esther*, 63 Mass. App. Ct. 122 (2005).  

16. Courts in Massachusetts have consistently held that midweek overnights must not interfere with a child's educational routine or well-being. See *Bak v. Bak*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 608 (1987).  

17. The Defendant's relocation to Cape Cod is a significant factor affecting the logistics and feasibility of midweek parenting time. See *Sullivan v. Sullivan*, 38 Mass. App. Ct. 64 (1995).  

18. In determining the best interests of the child, courts consider the developmental and educational needs of the child, as supported by *Custody of a Minor*, 389 Mass. 755 (1983).  

19. The Court is empowered to ensure that the custody arrangement supports the minor child’s need for rest and routine. See *Guardianship of Victoria*, 473 Mass. 64 (2015).  

20. Failure to modify the custody order under these changed circumstances would disrupt Sophie’s stability and well-being, contrary to her best interests. See *G.A.L. v. O.R.P.*, 73 Mass. App. Ct. 144 (2008).  

**CERTIFICATION OF EFFORTS TO RESOLVE**  
Pursuant to Massachusetts Supplemental Probate and Family Court Rule 401, the Plaintiff certifies that she has made reasonable attempts to resolve the issues herein with the Defendant through direct communication, but these efforts have been unsuccessful.  

**CONCLUSION**  
WHEREFORE, for all the foregoing reasons, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court grant her Complaint for Modification and issue an order modifying the prior custody order to eliminate the midweek overnight and adjust the parenting schedule in a manner that serves the best interests of the minor child.  

Respectfully submitted,  
Laura Mitchell  
Plaintiff, pro se
