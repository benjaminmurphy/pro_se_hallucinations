**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

**INTRODUCTION**  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Miller, in the above-entitled action and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court for a modification of the custody order issued by the Norfolk Probate and Family Court on May 15, 2018. The Plaintiff states that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the date of the original custody order such that a modification is necessary to serve the best interests of the minor child, Emily Miller, age 10.

**PARTIES**  

1. **Plaintiff**: Jessica Miller resides at [YOUR FULL ADDRESS], Norfolk County, Massachusetts. Plaintiff completed graduate school, is employed full time in a stable job, and resides in a two-bedroom apartment where the minor child, Emily Miller, has her own dedicated room.  
   
2. **Defendant**: Kevin Miller resides at [DEFENDANT'S FULL ADDRESS], Norfolk County, Massachusetts. Defendant currently has primary physical custody of the minor child under the existing order.  

3. **Minor Child**: Emily Miller, age 10, resides primarily with the Defendant pursuant to the original custody order entered on May 15, 2018.

**FACTUAL BACKGROUND**  

4. On May 15, 2018, the Norfolk Probate and Family Court entered an order granting primary physical custody of the minor child, Emily Miller, to the Defendant, Kevin Miller, and awarding limited parenting time to the Plaintiff, Jessica Miller, consisting of weekend visits and one weeknight dinner per week.  

5. The custody arrangement determined in 2018 was based on Plaintiff’s circumstances at the time, including Plaintiff’s enrollment in graduate school, her lack of a flexible schedule due to academic commitments, and her residence in a small studio apartment that was not conducive to extended parenting time with her young child.  

6. Since the issuance of the original custody order, there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances. Plaintiff has successfully completed graduate school, secured stable full-time employment with regular hours, and moved into a two-bedroom apartment in which Emily has her own dedicated bedroom.  

7. Over the past several years, Plaintiff and Emily have developed a close and loving relationship. Emily often expresses sadness and guilt about the limited time she can spend with her mother under the current custody arrangement.  

8. Emily has seen a licensed therapist, who has expressed professional concerns about the negative emotional impact of the child’s current limited parenting time with the Plaintiff. According to the therapist, these feelings are causing significant distress for Emily, who desires more equitable time with her mother.  

9. Emily has written a letter to the Court expressing her desire for additional overnight visits with her mother, reflecting her preference for a more balanced custodial schedule.  

10. All of the above-described circumstances justify a modification of the existing custody order to ensure that the schedule is consistent with the child’s best interests under Massachusetts law.

**RELIEF REQUESTED**  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Miller, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

A. Modify the custody order entered on May 15, 2018, to provide for a parenting schedule in which the Plaintiff and Defendant share more equitable parenting time, including overnights, consistent with the minor child’s best interests;  

B. Order that the Plaintiff have primary or shared physical custody of Emily Miller, based on the substantial and material changes in circumstances and the child’s expressed preference;  

C. Order that the Defendant be required to cooperate in good faith to facilitate a more reasonable parenting schedule, including participation in parenting mediation if necessary;  

D. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

**LEGAL STANDARD AND AUTHORITIES**  

This Complaint is brought pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, which governs changes in custody and recognizes that a material and substantial change in circumstances justifies modification when it serves the child’s best interests. The defining principle underlying child custody arrangements in Massachusetts is to ensure the best interests of the child. *See Custody of Zia, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 237, 239 (2000); Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 839 (2003).*  

In determining custody modifications, courts consider the totality of the circumstances, which may include changes in parental circumstances, the child’s mental and emotional well-being, and the importance of continued and meaningful relationships with both parents. *See Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704, 710 (1985); Adoption of Hugo, 428 Mass. 219, 228 (1998).*  

10. In this case, the Plaintiff’s completion of graduate school, her stable employment, and her improved living arrangements constitute material and substantial changes warranting a review and modification of the prior order.  

11. The Court has also recognized the relevance of a child’s expressed preferences, especially when supported by expert testimony demonstrating emotional distress under the current custody arrangement. *See Guardianship of Minor, 42 Mass. App. Ct. 427, 434 (1997); Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404 (1981).*  

12. Moreover, judges in Massachusetts are encouraged to adopt custody orders that reflect a favorable balance between the rights of both parents and the long-term best interests of the child. *See Woodside v. Woodside, 79 Mass. App. Ct. 713, 719 (2011); Maldonado v. Maldonado, 55 Mass. App. Ct. 607, 611 (2002).*

13. In evaluating modifications, courts have repeatedly emphasized the importance of parental cooperation and open communication. *See Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540, 549 (2010).*

Given the legal standards and factual circumstances in this case, the Plaintiff respectfully submits that modification of the existing custody order is appropriate and necessary to better serve the best interests of Emily Miller.
