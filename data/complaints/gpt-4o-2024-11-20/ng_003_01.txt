**Jason Thompson,**  
Plaintiff,  
v.  
**HomeGoods Discount Store,**  
Defendant.  

**COMPLAINT**  

**INTRODUCTION**  
1. This is a civil action seeking damages for personal injuries sustained by Plaintiff, Jason Thompson, due to the negligent acts and omissions of Defendant, HomeGoods Discount Store, in failing to properly secure heavy merchandise on its shelves, resulting in a box falling and striking Plaintiff on or about September 15, 2023, at Defendant's store located at 45 Market Street, Lowell, Massachusetts.

**PARTIES**  
2. Plaintiff Jason Thompson ("Plaintiff") is an individual residing in Massachusetts. Plaintiff is a delivery driver and was injured while lawfully on the premises of Defendant's store.  

3. Defendant HomeGoods Discount Store ("Defendant") is a business organization with a principal place of business in Massachusetts, and it operates the retail store located at 45 Market Street, Lowell, MA 01852.

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19, as the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of the District Court.  

5. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1, as the acts and omissions giving rise to this action occurred in Lowell, Massachusetts, and the Defendant operates a place of business in this judicial district.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
6. On or about September 15, 2023, Plaintiff was shopping at Defendant's retail store, located at 45 Market Street, Lowell, MA.  

7. While Plaintiff was looking at merchandise on Defendant's shelves, another customer bumped a cart into one of the lower shelves. The jostling of the shelf caused a box containing a heavy toaster oven, stored on a high shelf without any straps, guards, or other stabilization, to fall.  

8. The box struck Plaintiff on his head and shoulder, causing him immediate dizziness, pain, and discomfort.  

9. The store manager completed an incident report and offered Plaintiff a store coupon but took no further steps to address the conditions that caused the incident.

10. That evening, Plaintiff sought medical treatment in an emergency room, where he received a diagnosis of a mild concussion and a shoulder strain.  

11. As a result of his injuries, Plaintiff missed multiple days of work, incurring approximately $1,200 in lost wages, and incurred approximately $2,500 in medical expenses.  

12. Plaintiff also suffered inconvenience, pain, and an inability to partake in recreational activities, including soccer, for approximately one month.  

13. Defendant owed a duty to Plaintiff, as a business invitee, to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition and to take reasonable precautions to protect customers from foreseeable harm.

14. Defendant breached this duty by failing to properly secure heavy merchandise placed on its shelves and by failing to implement safeguards, such as barriers or tie-down straps, to prevent items from falling.

15. Defendant's negligence was the proximate cause of Plaintiff's injuries and damages.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  

**Count I – Negligence**  
16. Plaintiff restates and incorporates the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1–15.  

17. Under Massachusetts law, a landowner or business operator owes a duty of reasonable care to those lawfully present on its premises, as stated in _Mounsey v. Ellard_, 363 Mass. 693 (1973).  

18. Defendant breached this duty by failing to:  
   a. Secure the heavy merchandise on its shelving units in a manner that would prevent items from falling;  
   b. Adequately inspect and maintain shelving to ensure that merchandise was safely stored; and  
   c. Warn customers, including Plaintiff, of the unsafe condition of the store’s shelves.  

19. It was reasonably foreseeable that heavy boxes stored on shelves without adequate stabilization could fall and cause injury to customers. See _Poirier v. Plymouth_, 374 Mass. 206, 211 (1978).  

20. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered injuries that were both foreseeable and preventable.  

21. Defendant’s failure to take reasonable steps to prevent the danger constituted negligence per se, as it violated both common-law standards of care and the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act, G.L. c. 93A. See _Ulwick v. DeChristopher_, 411 Mass. 401, 408-09 (1991).  

22. Plaintiff’s injuries, losses, and damages were directly and proximately caused by Defendant’s negligence, as described in _Papadopoulos v. Target Corp._, 457 Mass. 368 (2010).  

**DAMAGES**  
23. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent conduct, Plaintiff has suffered the following damages:  
   a. $2,500 in medical expenses, for which Plaintiff seeks recovery;  
   b. $1,200 in lost wages;  
   c. Pain and suffering caused by injuries including a mild concussion and shoulder strain; and  
   d. Loss of enjoyment of life and ability to participate in recreational activities, including playing soccer.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jason Thompson respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  
1. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant;  
2. Award Plaintiff damages in an amount to be determined by the evidence at trial, but not less than $3,700 for economic damages;  
3. Award Plaintiff additional damages for pain and suffering, in an amount to be determined by the Court or jury;  
4. Award Plaintiff costs, interest, and attorney’s fees as permitted by law; and  
5. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

**DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL**  
Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,  

**Jason Thompson, pro se**
