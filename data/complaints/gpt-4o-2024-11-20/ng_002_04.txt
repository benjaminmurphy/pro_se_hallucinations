v.  

**Mark Stevens,**  
**Defendant.**  

CIVIL ACTION NO. __________  

**COMPLAINT**  

**PRELIMINARY STATEMENT**  
This is a personal injury action arising out of the negligence of Defendant Mark Stevens, who violated Massachusetts negligence law by failing to exercise reasonable care in controlling his dog, resulting in Plaintiff Emily Johnson’s fall, injury, and financial damages.  

**PARTIES**  

1. Plaintiff Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing in Newton, Massachusetts.  
2. Defendant Mark Stevens (“Defendant”) is an individual residing in Newton, Massachusetts, or otherwise domiciled within the jurisdiction of this Court.

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19, as the amount in controversy does not exceed $50,000 and the events giving rise to this claim occurred in Newton, Massachusetts.  
4. Venue is proper in Newton District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 2, as the incident occurred within this district.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

5. On September 15, 2023, Plaintiff was jogging along a designated pedestrian path at Hammond Pond Parkway, Newton, MA.  
6. The City of Newton maintains signs at the park requiring all dogs to be leashed and under their owner’s control at all times.  
7. Defendant was present at the park with his dog, a large, off-leash dog, despite carrying the leash over his shoulder without it being attached to the dog.  
8. Defendant negligently allowed the dog to roam freely without a leash or suitable supervision in violation of Newton City Ordinance § 3-17.  
9. While Plaintiff was jogging, Defendant’s unleashed dog suddenly charged in her direction, barking loudly.  
10. Defendant, who was approximately thirty feet away, failed to control or restrain the dog at that moment.  
11. Fearing an imminent attack from the dog, Plaintiff reasonably swerved off the jogging path to avoid being bitten or harmed.  
12. As a result of swerving off the path, Plaintiff tripped over a tree root and fell down a nearby embankment, resulting in a fractured wrist.  
13. The dog stopped and returned to Defendant only after Plaintiff had fallen and Defendant belatedly called the dog back.  
14. The incident was witnessed by several other parkgoers, including other joggers who can provide testimony corroborating the event.  
15. Plaintiff’s injuries required emergency medical care, which included a visit to the ER, wearing a wrist brace for several weeks, and ongoing discomfort and impairment in her daily life.  
16. Plaintiff incurred approximately $4,500 in medical expenses and $1,200 in lost wages due to missing work and regular activities such as a piano recital in which she was scheduled to perform.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION: NEGLIGENCE**  

17. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 16 above.  
18. Under Massachusetts law, negligence requires a plaintiff to establish that the defendant owed a duty of care, breached that duty, and proximately caused the plaintiff's injuries. *See Glidden v. Maglio, 430 Mass. 694, 696–97 (2000).*  
19. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of reasonable care, including complying with local ordinances requiring dogs to be kept on a leash. *See Aylaian v. Town of Grafton, 95 Mass. App. Ct. 513, 516 (2019).*  
20. Defendant breached his duty of care by negligently failing to leash or restrain his dog in a known public space, in violation of Newton City Ordinance § 3-17.  
21. Defendant’s failure to control his dog created a foreseeable risk of harm to parkgoers, including Plaintiff. *See Irwin v. Town of Ware, 392 Mass. 745, 756 (1984).*  
22. Defendant’s negligence proximately caused Plaintiff to swerve off the jogging path to escape what she reasonably perceived as a charging dog, leading directly to her fall and injuries. *See Wallace v. Wilson, 411 Mass. 8, 11 (1991).*  
23. Defendant knew or should have known that allowing his dog to roam unleashed created a foreseeable hazard to people using the park, including joggers like Plaintiff. *See Papadopoulos v. Target Corp., 457 Mass. 368, 373 (2010).*  
24. Plaintiff’s injuries and damages are a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of his duty of care.  

**DAMAGES**  

25. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered the following damages:  
   a. Medical expenses in the amount of approximately $4,500.  
   b. Lost wages in the amount of approximately $1,200.  
   c. Severe pain and suffering, including emotional distress arising from the incident and its aftereffects.  
   d. Inability to participate in regular activities, such as the piano recital referenced above.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and award the following relief:  

1. Compensatory damages in the amount of $5,700, or such other amount as this Court deems just and equitable;  
2. Damages for pain and suffering, including emotional distress, in an amount to be determined at trial;  
3. Attorney’s fees and costs pursuant to applicable rules of law;  
4. Pre- and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;  
5. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

**JURY DEMAND**  

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,
