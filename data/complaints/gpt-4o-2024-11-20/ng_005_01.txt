Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MARK REYNOLDS**,  
Defendant.  

_______________________________/  

**COMPLAINT**  

**I. INTRODUCTION**  
1. This is a civil action brought by Plaintiff Jessica Thompson against Defendant Mark Reynolds seeking compensatory damages for damage to Plaintiff’s automobile caused by Defendant’s negligent conduct in failing to secure a dangerous condition on his property, in violation of Massachusetts negligence law.  

2. This Court has jurisdiction and venue pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1, as the damages to Plaintiff’s property occurred at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts, located within Hampden County.  

**II. PARTIES**  
3. Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, is a resident of Massachusetts who resides at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts.  

4. Defendant, Mark Reynolds, is the owner and occupant of the other half of the duplex at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts.  

**III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
5. Plaintiff and Defendant share a driveway at the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts.  

6. Defendant has a habit of leaving a tall aluminum extension ladder leaning unsecured against a wooden fence next to the shared driveway.  

7. Plaintiff had previously brought the unsafe condition to Defendant’s attention on multiple occasions, specifically expressing concern that the ladder might fall onto her car, particularly during windy weather.  

8. Defendant acknowledged these concerns and represented to Plaintiff that he would take corrective action by either securing the ladder or moving it to a safer location.  

9. Despite these assurances, Defendant failed to take any action to secure or remove the ladder.  

10. On or about March 15, 2023, during a windy day, the unsecured ladder was blown over by a strong gust of wind.  

11. At the time of the incident, Plaintiff was in the process of reversing her car into the shared driveway when Defendant’s ladder fell and struck her vehicle.  

12. The ladder caused substantial damage to Plaintiff’s car, including a dented hood and a cracked windshield.  

13. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s failure to secure the ladder despite being on notice of the risks, Plaintiff has incurred economic damages, including but not limited to: 

    a. Payment of her insurance deductible for the repair of her car;  

    b. Costs of a rental car while her vehicle was repaired; and  

    c. Other associated expenses.  

14. Defendant owed a duty of care to Plaintiff, as a neighbor sharing space and a driveway, to prevent foreseeable harm caused by conditions on his property.  

15. Defendant breached this duty by failing to take reasonable steps to secure the ladder, particularly after Plaintiff specifically warned him of the unsafe condition.  

16. Defendant’s failure to act as a reasonably prudent person constitutes negligence under Massachusetts law.  

**IV. CAUSE OF ACTION – NEGLIGENCE**  
17. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 16 as though fully set forth herein.  

18. Defendant had a duty under Massachusetts law to exercise reasonable care to maintain his property and prevent dangerous conditions from harming others. *(MacCormack v. Boston Edison Co., 423 Mass. 652, 661 (1996)).*  

19. Massachusetts negligence law requires individuals to take reasonable precautions to ensure their actions or omissions do not create foreseeable harm to others. *(Whitman v. Reed, 93 Mass. App. Ct. 592, 595 (2018)).*  

20. Defendant breached his duty of care by failing to secure or remove the aluminum ladder despite actual and specific notice of the risk it posed to Plaintiff and her vehicle. *(See Gagnon v. Amaral, 14 Mass. App. Ct. 780, 782 (1982) (landowners have a duty to prevent harm from known dangers on their property)).*  

21. Defendant’s failure to reasonably secure the ladder created an unreasonably dangerous condition that foreseeably led to the harm Plaintiff suffered. *(See Dos Santos v. Coleta, 465 Mass. 148, 154 (2013) (duty arises where harm is foreseeable)).*  

22. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered damages to her vehicle and related financial losses. *(See Cypress v. Newport Partners, 71 Mass. App. Ct. 82, 86 (2008) (defendant liable for harms caused by their failure to mitigate known risks)).*  

**V. DAMAGES**  
23. Plaintiff has suffered the following economic damages due to Defendant’s negligence:  
    a. Payment of an insurance deductible in the amount of $500.  
    b. Costs of a rental car in the amount of $250.  
    c. Other out-of-pocket expenses as determined at trial.  

**VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Thompson respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment against Defendant Mark Reynolds as follows:  

1. Compensatory damages in the amount of $750, or such greater amount as may be proven at trial.  

2. Court costs, interest, and any other relief the Court deems just and equitable.  

**VII. JURY DEMAND**  
Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable pursuant to Rule 38 of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure.  

Respectfully submitted this 1st day of December, 2025.
