We consider that factor not in itself conclusive. The best interests of children for purposes of deciding whether to permit removal are also interwoven with the well being of the custodial parent, and the determination, therefore, requires that the interests of the mother also be taken into account.... The court should not insist that the advantages of the move be sacrificed ... solely to maintain weekly visitation by the father."
