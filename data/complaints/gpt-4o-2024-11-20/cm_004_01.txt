### COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
### PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT DEPARTMENT  
### BRISTOL COUNTY  

**Docket No.: [Insert Case Number]**  

**_____________________________________**  
**Rachel Bennett,**  
Plaintiff,  
v.  
**Thomas Bennett,**  
Defendant.  
**_____________________________________**  

### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  

**INTRODUCTION**  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Rachel Bennett, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 208, § 28A, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody order issued on April 15, 2019, by the Bristol County Probate and Family Court. A material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the minor child, Ethan Bennett, has occurred since the entry of the original order, warranting modification of custody and parenting time arrangements.  

In support of this Complaint, the Plaintiff states as follows:  

---

### PARTIES  

1. The Plaintiff, Rachel Bennett, resides at [Insert Plaintiff's Address], in Massachusetts. She is the natural and custodial mother of Ethan Bennett, the minor child born to the parties.  
2. The Defendant, Thomas Bennett, resides at [Insert Defendant's Address], in Massachusetts. He is the natural father of Ethan Bennett.

### FACTUAL BACKGROUND  

3. On April 15, 2019, this Court entered a custody and parenting time order granting the Plaintiff, Rachel Bennett, primary physical custody and the Defendant, Thomas Bennett, three midweek visits of short duration on school nights, as well as one Sunday afternoon visit per week, without overnights.  
4. At the time of the initial custody determination, Thomas Bennett was residing in a shared apartment with roommates and lacked a suitable, private space for Ethan to stay overnight.  
5. The current custody arrangement requires significant back-and-forth exchanges during school nights, which has become increasingly disruptive to Ethan's full-time educational schedule, bedtime routine, and homework requirements.  
6. At present, Thomas Bennett resides in his own private apartment, where Ethan has his own bedroom and appropriate accommodations for overnight visits.  
7. Ethan Bennett, now eight years old, has expressed a consistent and ongoing desire to spend overnight parenting time at his father’s residence, recognizing the improvements in his father’s living situation and the strong relationship he shares with both parents.  
8. Both Rachel Bennett and Thomas Bennett now agree that the current parenting schedule is no longer suitable given Ethan’s age, school obligations, developmental needs, and the significant changes in circumstances.  

---

### LEGAL STANDARD FOR MODIFICATION  

9. Under Massachusetts law, G.L. c. 208, § 28 provides that child custody and parenting time orders may be modified upon a showing that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred, and that such a modification is in the best interests of the child.  
10. In determining the best interests of a child, courts must consider a variety of factors, including the child’s age, educational needs, emotional well-being, and each parent’s ability to meet those needs. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 840 (2003); Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177, 183–84 (2006).

### MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES  

11. A material and substantial change in circumstances exists, as follows:  
   a. The Defendant, Thomas Bennett, now resides in a private apartment with adequate living arrangements for Ethan, including his own bedroom, thereby addressing the court’s previous concerns regarding overnight parenting time.  
   b. The current parenting schedule does not align with Ethan’s status as a school-aged child in full-time education, as the midweek short visits disrupt his routine and limit the Plaintiff’s ability to ensure proper bedtime and homework completion.  
   c. Both parties now agree that a modified schedule is both desirable and necessary to better meet Ethan’s developmental and educational needs.  

---

### BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD  

12. It is in Ethan’s best interests to modify the current custody order to allow for a more balanced and efficient parenting schedule that facilitates overnights with Thomas Bennett. This modification will reduce the number of disruptive midweek transfers, ensure better continuity of care, and support Ethan’s emotional and developmental needs.  
13. The Massachusetts courts have long recognized that a modified parenting schedule that responds to the child’s changing needs as they grow is essential for their well-being. See Carr v. Carr, 44 Mass. App. Ct. 924, 926 (1998); Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734, 738 (1996).  

---

### REQUESTED RELIEF  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Rachel Bennett, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Modify the existing custody and parenting time order entered on April 15, 2019, to:  
   a. Establish a parenting schedule more appropriate for Ethan’s school-aged developmental stage;  
   b. Allow for overnight parenting time with the Defendant, Thomas Bennett; and  
   c. Reduce or eliminate midweek parenting exchanges that disrupt Ethan’s routine and educational schedule.  
2. Issue any further orders as this Court deems just and proper to promote the best interests of Ethan Bennett.
