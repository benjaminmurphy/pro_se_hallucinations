The court\u2019s analysis is limited to measuring rent abatement (difference between value as warranted and in defective condition) and makes no mention of the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment or additional expense recovery. Thus the case does not support the specific proposition about being forced to incur extra living expenses in violation of habitability and quiet enjoyment.",

      "support_reasoning": "The opinion directly interprets the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code provisions on heat and hot water, holding that the owner of a dwelling must supply heat and hot water unless a written letting agreement requires the tenant to supply the fuel. Because there was only an oral agreement here, the landlord remained obligated under the Code, so his failure to ensure adequate heat constituted a violation of the State Sanitary Code requirement to provide sufficient heat in habitable premises.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe tenant maintains that under the State Sanitary Code the landlord is not excused from his obligation to provide heat and hot water unless there is a writing transferring the obligation to the tenant. The State Sanitary Code, 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 410.190 and 410.201 (1983), provides that the owner of a dwelling \u2018shall\u2019 supply heat and hot water \u2018except and to the extent that the occupant is required to supply the fuel under a written letting agreement.\u2019 \u2026 The plain and unambiguous language of the regulation indicates that a writing is required when the obligation to provide heat and hot water is transferred to the tenant.\u201d"

It does not address standards for willful or negligent conduct, nor does it analyze a defendant\u2019s actions or inactions in terms of negligence or willfulness. Therefore it does not provide authority for the proposition that the defendant\u2019s actions and inactions were willful and/or negligent.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "We now address the issue whether the mandatory death penalty for murder committed in the course of rape or attempted rape, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 2, is constitutional.

      "support_confidence": "high",
      "support_reasoning": "The opinion directly holds that liability under the quiet enjoyment statute requires at least negligent conduct and discusses landlord conduct that can be characterized as willful, reckless, or negligent. Although the case is about statutory quiet enjoyment in the context of lead paint, it clearly states that a landlord\u2019s actions or inactions must involve some degree of fault (at least negligence) to give rise to liability, which supports the general proposition that a defendant\u2019s conduct can be willful and/or negligent.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Today we make clear what was implicit in those rulings: to support the imposition of liability under the quiet enjoyment statute, there must be a showing of at least negligent conduct by a landlord and violation of the lead paint statute alone is not sufficient to prove such negligence. Stated differently, to obtain relief under \u00a7 14 for a claim of lead paint poisoning it must be demonstrated that the landlord had notice of or reason to know of the presence of lead and failed to take appropriate corrective measures."
