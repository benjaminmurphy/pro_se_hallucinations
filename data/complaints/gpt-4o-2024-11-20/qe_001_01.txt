   Plaintiff,  

v.  

**Michael Roberts,**  
   Defendant.  
_______________________________________  

**Civil Action No.: [To be Assigned]**  

**COMPLAINT**  

**INTRODUCTION**  

1. This is a civil action brought by Plaintiff Jessica Turner against her landlord, Michael Roberts, for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, in violation of Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 186, Section 14, and other applicable Massachusetts landlord-tenant laws and legal precedents.  

2. Defendant's failure to provide adequate heat during the winter of 2024–2025 interfered substantially with Plaintiff’s right to peacefully enjoy her rental property, as required under Massachusetts law.  

**PARTIES**  

3. Plaintiff Jessica Turner is an individual who resides at 123 Elm Street, Apartment 2, Dorchester, Massachusetts, where she has lived since January 1, 2022, under a written rental agreement.  

4. Defendant Michael Roberts is the owner and landlord of the residential property located at 123 Elm Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

5. Venue is proper in the Boston Municipal Court, Dorchester Division, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 223, Section 1, as the property subject to this dispute is located within the jurisdiction of this court.  

6. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 186, Section 14 and related principles of Massachusetts landlord-tenant law.  

**STATEMENT OF FACTS**  

7. Plaintiff entered into a rental agreement with Defendant on January 1, 2022, to rent a two-bedroom apartment located at 123 Elm Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts. Plaintiff has complied with all obligations under the lease, including timely payment of monthly rent in the amount of $1,800.  

8. During the winter months of 2024–2025, the heating system in Plaintiff’s apartment repeatedly malfunctioned. Specifically, the temperature in the unit would drop to approximately 60 degrees Fahrenheit for several hours at a time, typically during the evenings.  

9. Plaintiff reported the issue to Defendant on multiple occasions. Defendant sent repair personnel to address the issue on two occasions: once in December 2024 and again in January 2025.  

10. Despite these repair attempts, the heating issues persisted. The contractor informed Plaintiff that the boiler was "old but functional" and that no further repairs were planned.  

11. As a result of the insufficient heat, Plaintiff was forced to purchase two space heaters in December 2024 to keep her apartment livable, incurring increased electricity costs of approximately $150 per month.  

12. Plaintiff contracted bronchitis in January 2025, which her doctor attributed in part to prolonged exposure to cold indoor temperatures. Plaintiff incurred medical expenses from doctor visits, prescriptions, and lost wages from three missed days of work.  

13. Defendant has refused to take adequate actions to ensure that the heating system functions reliably, asserting instead that the heat is “working” because the boiler does not completely fail and the building is not "freezing."  

14. The Massachusetts State Sanitary Code requires that landlords provide heating sufficient to maintain a minimum temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit during the daytime and 64 degrees Fahrenheit at night. 105 C.M.R. § 410.201. The conditions in Plaintiff's apartment fell below these standards, violating the law.  

15. Defendant's failure to provide adequate heat and maintain the premises in habitable condition has substantially interfered with Plaintiff's quiet enjoyment of the property, in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

**CLAIM FOR RELIEF**  
**(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment — G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  

16. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the foregoing allegations as if fully set forth herein.  

17. Under Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 186, Section 14, every residential lease includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, which obligates the landlord to provide the tenant possession of the premises free from substantial interference.  

18. Defendant's repeated failure to provide adequate and reliable heat during the winter months constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and quiet enjoyment of the apartment.  

19. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered monetary damages, including but not limited to:  
   a. Increased electric bills due to the need to use personal space heaters ($450);  
   b. Medical expenses incurred due to illness caused by the inadequate heating ($200);  
   c. Lost wages for three missed days of work ($350); and  
   d. General inconvenience and discomfort due to the inability to enjoy the apartment as contracted.  

20. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Defendant’s actions entitle Plaintiff to recover damages in an amount not less than three times the actual damages sustained, plus reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:  
1. Award judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14;  
2. Award Plaintiff monetary damages in an amount sufficient to compensate for her actual damages, including but not limited to increased utility costs, medical expenses, and lost wages, tripled pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14;  
3. Award Plaintiff additional damages for inconvenience, mental anguish, and general discomfort;  
4. Award Plaintiff her costs and disbursements in this action; and  
5. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

**JURY DEMAND**  

Pursuant to Rule 38 of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,  

Dated: December 1, 2025
