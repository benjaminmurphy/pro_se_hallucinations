In construing the removal statute and articulating the \u201creal advantage\u201d test, the court expressly grounds its analysis in the principle that removal must be in the child\u2019s best interests and that those best interests remain the central, overriding concern.

Instead, the court uses comparative work flexibility and day care use as part of a broader best-interests analysis.

The Probate Court failed to consider the special risks to the child in awarding custody to a father who had committed acts of violence against the mother. ... Requiring the courts to make explicit findings about the effect of the violence on the child and the appropriateness of the custody award in light of that effect will serve to keep these matters well in the foreground of the judges\u2019 thinking.\""

The custody and visitation modification here is based on domestic violence, coercive control, and the child\u2019s best interests, including a one-year suspension of all contact, not on a parent\u2019s work schedule changing.
