**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

4. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19 and c. 185C, § 3, as this matter concerns a landlord-tenant dispute for damages not exceeding $50,000.

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

6. On or about January 15, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a month-to-month residential lease agreement with Defendant for the premises located at 25 Fresh Pond Parkway, Unit #3, Cambridge, MA 02138 (the “Premises”), at a monthly rent of $2,500.

7. Defendant is the owner and landlord of the Premises and manages neighboring units within the same building.

8. Beginning in approximately October 2025, Defendant commenced substantial renovations to the residential unit directly adjacent to Plaintiff’s Premises.

9. The construction associated with such renovations has been ongoing for at least two months, and Defendant has informed Plaintiff that the renovations will continue for at least an additional one to two months.

10. The construction activities, occurring between approximately 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on weekdays, involve drilling, hammering, and loud conversations among workers, creating substantial noise that invades Plaintiff’s Premises.

11. Plaintiff works from home and conducts professional calls regularly, and the excessive noise generated by the adjacent construction has significantly interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to perform her work, maintain concentration, and enjoy the use of her space.

12. Additionally, construction dust has entered Plaintiff’s unit through the ventilation system, creating unhealthy living conditions and requiring Plaintiff to clean more frequently than usual.

13. Prior to commencing renovations, Defendant informed Plaintiff of the construction. However, despite Plaintiff’s repeated complaints regarding ongoing disruptions, Defendant has failed to take reasonable measures to mitigate the noise, dust, and invasions of Plaintiff’s peaceful enjoyment of the Premises.

14. Defendant’s offer of a $100 rent reduction for one month is woefully inadequate to compensate for the serious disruption and inconvenience caused by the construction activities.

15. Defendant’s actions constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and have caused Plaintiff actionable harm.

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment - G.L. c. 186, § 14)**

16. Plaintiff incorporates the allegations stated in paragraphs 1 through 15 as if fully stated herein.

17. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, every tenant in the Commonwealth is entitled to the covenant of quiet enjoyment, which prohibits a landlord from disturbing the tenant’s lawful use and enjoyment of the leased premises.

18. Defendant has breached Plaintiff’s covenant of quiet enjoyment by engaging in continuous and disruptive construction activities that render Plaintiff’s dwelling unsuitable for its intended residential purpose and by failing to mitigate such disturbances.

19. Defendant’s construction activities, including excessive and unreasonable noise and the infiltration of dust into Plaintiff’s unit, substantially interfere with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.

20. Defendant’s failure to take reasonable steps to mitigate these issues or provide adequate compensation despite knowledge of the impact caused further evidences a violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

21. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered monetary losses, emotional distress, and a substantial deprivation of her rights as a tenant under Massachusetts law.

22. Plaintiff is entitled to recover actual and statutory damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14.

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Jessica Howard, respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:

1. An award of damages, including but not limited to, actual damages of $3,000, representing the diminished value of the leased premises and the harm caused by Defendant’s breaches;

2. Statutory damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14, in an amount to be determined by this Court, including doubling or trebling of actual damages;

3. Costs of this action and reasonable attorneys’ fees (if permissible); and

4. Any such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
