COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT DEPARTMENT  
WESTON DIVISION  

**DOCKET NO.: [Insert Current Docket Number]**

**Samantha Carter, Plaintiff**  
v.  
**David Carter, Defendant**  

---  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Samantha Carter, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws c. 208, § 28, and respectfully moves this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody and parenting schedule for the minor child, Emily Carter. In support of this Complaint, the Plaintiff asserts and alleges as follows:  

### PARTIES  

1. The Plaintiff, **Samantha Carter**, resides at [Insert Address], Weston, Massachusetts.  
2. The Defendant, **David Carter**, resides at [Insert Address], Weston, Massachusetts.  

### JURISDICTION AND VENUE  

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, and G.L. c. 209C, § 20, as the minor child resides in the Commonwealth.  
4. Venue is proper in the Weston Probate and Family Court as the original custody order, dated May 15, 2018, was issued by this Court.  

### FACTUAL BACKGROUND  

5. The minor child, Emily Carter, was born on [Insert Date], and is currently ten (10) years old.  
6. On May 15, 2018, this Court issued an order granting primary physical custody of the minor child to the Defendant, David Carter, and limited parenting time to the Plaintiff, Samantha Carter.  
7. At the time of the original custody determination in 2018, the following circumstances existed:  
   a. The Plaintiff was pursuing a graduate degree, which required significant time commitments and limited her availability for parenting.  
   b. The Plaintiff lived in a small studio apartment, which was not conducive to regular overnight parenting time.  
   c. The Defendant's custody arrangement, with Plaintiff having limited weekend time and one weeknight dinner, was tailored to these circumstances.  

8. Since the entry of the order, substantial and material changes in circumstances have occurred, as described below:  
   a. The Plaintiff has completed her graduate degree and is now employed full-time in a stable job with normal hours, providing her with greater availability and flexibility to care for the minor child.  
   b. The Plaintiff has relocated to a two-bedroom apartment in Weston where the minor child has her own bedroom, creating a suitable and stable environment for overnight parenting.  
   c. The minor child has expressed her desire to spend more time with the Plaintiff. Through her therapist, the child has reported feelings of guilt about the limited time she spends with the Plaintiff and has expressed a clear preference for increasing her time in the Plaintiff's care.  
   d. The minor child has written a letter to this Court requesting additional parenting time with the Plaintiff to strengthen their bond.  
   e. The Plaintiff and the minor child have become significantly closer over the years, enjoying a strong, nurturing relationship that supports the emotional well-being and happiness of the child.  
   f. The Defendant has refused to engage in meaningful discussions regarding any adjustment to the current parenting plan and becomes angry when the topic is raised, which negatively impacts the minor child.  

### APPLICABLE LAW  

9. This Complaint is brought pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, which permits modification of a custody order upon a showing of a material change in circumstances and where modification is in the best interest of the child.  
10. Massachusetts law is clear that the child's best interests are paramount in custody and parenting time determinations. *See Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).  
11. A material change in circumstances justifies modification of the original custody order. *See Ardizoni v. Raymond*, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996). Here, the Plaintiff's improved living situation, stable employment, and availability, in conjunction with the wishes and emotional needs of the minor child, constitute material changes warranting modification.  
12. The Court may consider the child’s preferences when determining a custody modification that serves the child’s best interests. *See Bak v. Bak*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 608 (1987).  
13. Massachusetts places significant emphasis on maintaining frequent and continuing contact with both parents whenever possible, provided such contact is in the child’s best interests. *See Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996); G.L. c. 208, § 31.  
14. Courts favor custody and parenting arrangements that promote the child’s emotional welfare. *See Custody of Zia*, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 237 (2000).  
15. The continuing jurisdiction of the Probate and Family Court to modify custody orders exists to serve this purpose (*See Heistand v. Heistand*, 384 Mass. 20 (1981)), and this principle applies squarely to the instant matter.  

### RELIEF REQUESTED  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Enter an order modifying the judgment or order dated May 15, 2018, to adjust the current parenting schedule in accordance with the best interests of the minor child.  
2. Grant the Plaintiff increased parenting time, including extended overnight visits and weekday time with the minor child.  
3. Require co-parenting counseling or other dispute resolution services to address constructive communication in the best interest of the child, if deemed necessary.  
4. Grant such further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

### VERIFICATION AND SIGNATURE  

Signed under the penalties of perjury this 1st day of December, 2025.  

Respectfully Submitted,
