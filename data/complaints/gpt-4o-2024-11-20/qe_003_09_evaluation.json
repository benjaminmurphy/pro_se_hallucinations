      "support_reasoning": "The opinion expressly discusses G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, identifies it as the \u201cquiet enjoyment\u201d statute, and explains that it protects tenants from serious interference with their tenancy caused by the landlord\u2019s acts or omissions or by conditions the landlord permits to exist. The court holds that a landlord may be liable under \u00a7 14 where, by failing to act against unlawful drug activity by others on the premises, it permits a condition that seriously interferes with tenants\u2019 use and enjoyment of common areas. This aligns with the proposition that every residential lease includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment protecting against substantial interference caused by the landlord or persons/conditions under the landlord\u2019s control.",

The court specifically characterizes Gem\u2019s wrongdoing as an \u2018outrageous omission to act\u2019 that allowed repeated flooding which impaired Solomon\u2019s use of her apartment and created unsanitary, harmful conditions. That reasoning supports the proposition that a landlord\u2019s inaction depriving a tenant of full, comfortable, and healthful use of the rental unit violates the covenant/statutory right of quiet enjoyment.",

Therefore, Gem is liable under G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14.\u2026 Gem violated its underlying duty to maintain sanitary conditions in her apartment, and thereby permitted repeated flooding to occur that interfered with her quiet enjoyment of her apartment\u2026 it could be found that Gem violated its duty to Solomon recklessly, by outrageous omission to act.\u201d"

It does not discuss or establish any rule about the types of damages a plaintiff may recover, such as loss of use of an apartment, property damage, or health concerns. Although the case mentions that the plaintiffs suffered lead poisoning and recovered compensatory damages, it does not set out a legal principle on damages that would support the specific proposition cited.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cIn response to special questions, the jury found that lead paint on the premises was the proximate cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries, and awarded $25,000 in compensatory damages to Dina and $10,000 in compensatory damages to Husam. \u2026 On appeal, the landlords do not dispute that the apartment contained lead paint, or that the plaintiffs\u2019 lead poisoning was proximately caused by the lead in the apartment\u2026 The only question is whether on this record the plaintiffs were entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees under G.

It does not address or analyze damages such as loss of use of an apartment, property damage, or health concerns suffered by a plaintiff as a direct and proximate result of a defendant\u2019s actions. Thus, it does not provide authority for the causation-and-damages proposition stated.",
