**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**SUFFOLK COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT**  

**Jason Miller,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**Rideshare Solutions, Inc.,**  
Defendant.  

CIVIL ACTION NO. ____________  

**COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND**  

**INTRODUCTION**  
1. This is an action for negligence arising from a collision caused by the careless and reckless actions of an employee or agent of the Defendant, Rideshare Solutions, Inc., which resulted in personal injuries and property damage to the Plaintiff, Jason Miller, while Plaintiff was lawfully riding his bicycle in a designated bike lane in Boston, Massachusetts.  

**PARTIES**  
2. Plaintiff Jason Miller (“Plaintiff”) is an individual residing in Boston, Massachusetts.  

3. Defendant Rideshare Solutions, Inc. (“Defendant”) is a corporation engaged in commercial ridesharing and transportation services, with a principal office located at [INSERT DEFENDANT'S BUSINESS ADDRESS, if known]. Defendant is authorized to do business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 3, as the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000.  

5. Venue is proper in Suffolk County Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1, because the acts and omissions giving rise to this action occurred in Suffolk County, Massachusetts.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
6. On September 10, 2023, at approximately 8:15 a.m., Plaintiff was riding his bicycle in a marked bike lane on Commonwealth Avenue, near 418 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, MA 02215.  

7. Plaintiff was operating his bicycle in compliance with all applicable traffic laws and was wearing a helmet.  

8. At the above time and location, a driver employed by or acting as an agent of Defendant Rideshare Solutions, Inc., was parked in a designated loading zone adjacent to the bike lane.  

9. Without warning and without taking reasonable care to check his surroundings, the driver abruptly opened the door of his vehicle into the bike lane directly in Plaintiff’s path.  

10. The sudden opening of the driver’s door caused Plaintiff to collide with the door, resulting in Plaintiff being violently ejected from his bicycle and striking the pavement.  

11. At the scene of the incident, the driver admitted that he had not seen Plaintiff and further stated that he had been looking at his phone at the time.  

12. Defendant's driver, as an employee or agent of Defendant, had a duty to exercise reasonable care under G.L. c. 89, § 14 and G.L. c. 90, § 14, including the duty to check for oncoming bicycles before opening a car door adjacent to a bike lane.  

13. As a direct result of the driver’s negligent actions, Plaintiff suffered physical injuries, property damage, and economic losses, including:  
    a. Road rash on his arms and legs;  
    b. A chipped front tooth;  
    c. Damage to his bicycle frame; and  
    d. Lost wages and medical expenses.  

14. Plaintiff’s medical expenses resulting from the incident are approximately $1,500.  

15. Plaintiff lost approximately $600 in wages due to his injuries, as he was unable to work during his recovery.  

16. Plaintiff was required to replace his bicycle, incurring additional expenses.  

**COUNT I: NEGLIGENCE**  
17. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 16 as if fully set forth herein.  

18. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of care to ensure that its drivers operated their vehicles safely and in compliance with Massachusetts laws, including those governing the safe opening of vehicle doors adjacent to bike lanes.  

19. Defendant’s driver breached this duty by:  
    a. Failing to check for oncoming bicycles before opening his door;  
    b. Opening his door into a bike lane without ensuring that it could be done safely; and  
    c. Focusing on his phone instead of his surroundings.  

20. Defendant is vicariously liable for the acts and omissions of its driver under the doctrine of respondeat superior, as the driver was acting within the scope of his employment or agency at the time of the incident.  

21. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence and that of its driver, Plaintiff suffered damages, including physical injuries, property damage, lost wages, medical expenses, and pain and suffering.  

**CASES AND STATUTORY AUTHORITY**  
22. Defendant's duty to use reasonable care is well-established under Massachusetts law. See *Gouin v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co.*, 165 F.2d 449, 450 (1st Cir. 1948).  

23. General Laws c. 89, § 14 and G.L. c. 90, § 14 specifically require drivers to open car doors only when it is safe to do so, thereby protecting cyclists from harm.  

24. Courts in Massachusetts have long held that violating a statute designed to protect the public, such as G.L. c. 89, § 14, constitutes evidence of negligence. See *Adamian v. Three Sons, Inc.*, 353 Mass. 498, 499-500 (1968); *Glick v. Prince Italian Foods of Saugus, Inc.*, 25 Mass. App. Ct. 901, 902 (1987).  

25. The principle of vicarious liability for an employer's negligence is well-established. See *Dias v. Brigham Med. Assocs., Inc.*, 438 Mass. 317, 319 (2002).  

26. Massachusetts courts recognize that cyclists are entitled to the same protections under the law as other users of the road. See *Braman v. Worcester Consolidated St. Ry. Co.*, 264 Mass. 240, 243 (1928).  

27. The Defendant’s failure to properly monitor and train its drivers on the specific risks to cyclists constitutes actionable negligence, as recognized in *Gore v. Arbella Mut. Ins. Co.*, 77 Mass. App. Ct. 518, 522 (2010).  

28. Plaintiff’s injuries and damages were a foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s breach of duty, consistent with the precedent set in *Wallace v. Wilson*, 411 Mass. 8, 14 (1991).  

29. This Court has further held that distraction, such as using a phone while driving or parking, constitutes negligence. See *Commonwealth v. Galluccio*, 11 Mass. App. Ct. 190, 191-92 (1981).  

30. Defendant’s broader duty of care to cyclists in proximity to its vehicles is recognized by Massachusetts law and caselaw. See *Dolan v. Suffolk Frank P. Morrissey Coffee Co.*, 322 Mass. 76, 78 (1947).  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court grant the following relief:  
A. Judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant on all counts of this Complaint;  
B. An award of compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, including but not limited to damages for past and future medical expenses, lost wages, property damage, and pain and suffering;  
C. Prejudgment interest pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B;  
D. Costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in this action; and  
E. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.  

**DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL**  
Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

**Respectfully submitted,**  

Dated: December 1, 2025
