It does not involve a defendant operating a facility, supervision of a minor during activities, or any discussion of a duty to provide a safe environment or protect a child from foreseeable harm in that context. Thus, it does not address or establish the specific duty described in the proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "On the morning of December 14, 1985, Marc Albert was driving east on Beacon Street in Newton, with Philip Leibovich sitting on the passenger side. Mark Antonellis was driving west on the same street in a pickup truck, approaching Albert\u2019s vehicle from the opposite direction. The accident occurred when Albert attempted to make a left turn and Antonellis\u2019 truck struck the passenger side of Albert\u2019s automobile, severely injuring Philip."

Gillette Stadium Corp. opinion is a Massachusetts contract interpretation/tax allocation case about value-added tax receivables in a stock purchase agreement. It does not involve negligence, premises liability, duties to supervise, foreseeability of physical harm, or staff intervention in rough play. Therefore it cannot provide authority for the proposition that a defendant breached a duty by disregarding reports of rough play and failing to intervene to prevent foreseeable harm to A.J.",

(Beam), sold its subsidiary, Acushnet Company (Acushnet). More specifically, the parties disagree as to which of them is entitled to $16.62 million of value added tax (VAT) receivables carried on Acushnet's balance sheet at the time of the closing.... On appeal, Acushnet argues (1) that the motion judge erred, as a matter of law, when she concluded that the contract provision was ambiguous; and (2) that the trial judge's interpretation of the contract was clearly erroneous. We affirm.\""
