**SARAH THOMPSON,**    
   Plaintiff,  
v.  
**MICHAEL JOHNSON,**  
   Defendant.  
________________________________________  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

**INTRODUCTION**  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, residing at [Insert Address], in the County of Middlesex, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and respectfully requests this Honorable Court modify the prior custody order dated May 15, 2018, regarding the custody and parenting time of the parties’ minor child, Emily Johnson, born [Insert Date of Birth]. Pursuant to G. L. c. 208, § 28 and applicable case law, Plaintiff alleges that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the original order and that modification is in the best interests of the minor child.

In support of this request for modification, Plaintiff states as follows:

-----------------------------------------------

**PARTIES**  

1. Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, is the mother of the minor child, Emily Johnson, and resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  
2. Defendant, Michael Johnson, is the father of the minor child, Emily Johnson, and resides at [Insert Address], Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  

-----------------------------------------------

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

3. This Complaint is brought pursuant to G. L. c. 208, § 28, which authorizes the modification of prior custody judgments when there has been a material change in circumstances, and such modification is in the best interests of the child.  
4. The Middlesex Probate and Family Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G. L. c. 209C, § 10, as both parties and the minor child reside within the Commonwealth.  

-----------------------------------------------

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

5. On or about May 15, 2018, the Middlesex Probate and Family Court entered a custody and parenting time order granting primary physical custody of Emily Johnson to Defendant, Michael Johnson, and awarding Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, limited parenting time consisting of alternating weekend visitation and one mid-week dinner.  
6. At the time of the original order, Plaintiff’s circumstances were such that an expanded parenting time schedule was not feasible. Specifically, Plaintiff was enrolled in a full-time graduate program and residing in a small studio apartment unsuitable for overnight visits.  
7. Since the entry of the original order, Plaintiff’s circumstances have materially and substantially changed. Plaintiff has graduated from her program, obtained a stable full-time job with regular hours, and secured a two-bedroom apartment in which Emily has a designated bedroom of her own.  
8. Over the last six years, Plaintiff has maintained consistent contact with the minor child. Their bond has grown exceedingly strong, and Emily has expressed her desire for increased time with Plaintiff, including overnight visits.  
9. Emily has been meeting with a licensed therapist since approximately [Insert Approximate Date]. During therapy sessions, Emily has expressed feelings of guilt and sadness over the limited time she spends with Plaintiff and has expressed a preference for a modification allowing for more frequent stays with Plaintiff. The therapist’s observations and recommendations support Emily having additional time with her mother.  
10. Emily has taken her wishes further by writing a letter to this Court expressing her desire to spend more overnights with Plaintiff.  
11. Plaintiff has made numerous attempts to discuss a modified parenting schedule with Defendant, but Defendant has refused to engage in any meaningful discussion and becomes hostile when the subject is raised, causing additional stress for the minor child.  

-----------------------------------------------

**LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION**  

12. Massachusetts law provides that a modification of a custody or parenting order may be granted upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and where modification is in the best interests of the child. See **G. L. c. 208, § 28; Partridge v. Partridge, 14 Mass. App. Ct. 918 (1982)**.  
13. A child’s best interests are the paramount consideration in any custody determination. See **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985)**.  
14. The court may consider the child’s expressed preferences, provided that the child possesses the maturity to articulate meaningful wishes. See **Bak v. Bak, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 608, 613 (1987)**.  
15. The strong bond between a child and each parent is a factor to be weighed heavily in custody determinations. See **Hale v. Hale, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 812, 819 (1981)**.  
16. The support and recommendations of treating professionals, such as therapists, are highly relevant to serve a child’s best interests. See **Gilmore v. Gilmore, 369 Mass. 598 (1976)**.  
17. A material improvement in a parent’s living situation or ability to care for the child can warrant modification of a prior custody order. See **Pizzino v. Miller, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865, 868 (2006)**.  

-----------------------------------------------

**REQUESTED MODIFICATION**  

18. Plaintiff respectfully requests this Honorable Court modify the custody and parenting order to allow for an expanded parenting schedule that includes alternating weekends, one midweek overnight, and additional time during school vacations and holidays, or any schedule that this Court deems to be in the minor child’s best interests.  
19. Such modification is in the best interests of the minor child, as it would foster her bond with Plaintiff, address her expressed emotional needs, and provide her with greater stability and support within Plaintiff’s household.  

-----------------------------------------------

**RELIEF REQUESTED**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests this Honorable Court enter an order:  

1. Finding that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the prior custody and parenting time order dated May 15, 2018.  
2. Modifying the custody and parenting time schedule to increase Plaintiff’s parenting time in a manner consistent with the best interests of the minor child.  
3. Granting such other relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

Respectfully submitted,  

DATED: December 1, 2025
