      "support_reasoning": "The court expressly explains that breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment turns on the landlord\u2019s conduct and not on intent, and that liability can arise where serious interference with the tenancy is the natural and probable consequence of what the landlord did, failed to do, or permitted. This recognizes landlord liability for substantial interference with quiet enjoyment without requiring malicious action. The opinion then applies that standard to possible omissions in addressing criminal activity on the premises.",

Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 716 (1977). Thus, a landlord may not intend to violate a tenant\u2019s right to quiet enjoyment, but may do so nevertheless when the breach is a \u2018natural and probable consequence of what the landlord did, what he failed to do, or what he permitted to be done.\u2019\u2026 If the defendant failed to take any action\u2026 then the defendant permitted a condition to exist that substantially interfered with the tenancies\u2026 and thus breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment.\u201d}"

While the case focuses on whether a strict liability statutory violation alone suffices (it does not), it affirms that non\u2011malicious negligent interference by a landlord can give rise to quiet enjoyment liability, which matches the proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "In Simon v. Solomon, supra at 101, we interpreted the new statute and concluded with respect to civil liability it was not necessary for a tenant to show malicious intent to recover against a landlord; we said that the statute covered \u201cat the least\u201d the reckless conduct that had been shown in that case. Id. Twelve years later, in Cruz Mgt. Co. v. Thomas, supra, we rejected a claim that a violation of G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, could be imposed only if it were proved that a landlord was reckless in disregarding his tenant\u2019s rights, and we concluded that negligent conduct, conduct involving \u201csome degree of fault,\u201d by a landlord could support the imposition of liability under \u00a7 14."

The court explains that \u201cquiet enjoyment\u201d covers serious interferences with the character and value of the leased premises and that \u00a7 14 liability extends at least to reckless interference with quiet enjoyment, including foreseeable emotional harm.
