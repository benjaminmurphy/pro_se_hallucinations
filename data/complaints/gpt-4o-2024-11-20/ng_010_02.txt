**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

5. Defendant is the owner and occupant of the residential property located at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, MA 01201.  
6. On and before July 15, 2023, a large maple tree was located in Defendant's front yard, adjacent to the public sidewalk running along 123 Maple Street.  
7. For a significant period prior to July 15, 2023, a large branch of the maple tree was visibly cracked, drooping, and at risk of falling onto the sidewalk.  
8. Plaintiff and other neighbors were aware of the dangerous condition of the branch. Plaintiff herself observed its deteriorated state and was told by neighbors that they had notified Defendant of the condition.  
9. Despite being made aware of the hazard, Defendant negligently failed to inspect, secure, trim, or otherwise address the visibly damaged tree branch.  
10. Defendant’s failure to address the hazardous condition demonstrated a disregard for the safety of pedestrians on the sidewalk, which Defendant knew or should have known was a reasonably foreseeable area of pedestrian travel and use.  
11. On July 15, 2023, at approximately 3:45 PM, Plaintiff was walking home along the sidewalk carrying groceries when the damaged branch snapped and fell during a thunderstorm.  
12. The branch struck Plaintiff on her right shoulder and back, knocking Plaintiff to the ground.  
13. As a result of the incident, Plaintiff sustained a right shoulder strain, multiple bruises, and significant pain and discomfort.  
14. Plaintiff sought medical treatment for her injuries and incurred medical expenses in the amount of approximately $2,500.  
15. Plaintiff missed approximately one week of work due to her injuries, resulting in a loss of wages in the amount of approximately $600.  
16. Defendant’s failure to act upon a known hazardous condition directly and proximately caused Plaintiff’s injuries and resulting damages.

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**(Negligence)**  

17. Plaintiff incorporates each of the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 16 as if fully set forth herein.

19. Defendant had actual knowledge or reasonably should have known of the defective and dangerous condition of the cracked tree branch as described above.  
20. Defendant breached his duty of care by failing to mitigate or remedy the hazardous condition of the cracked branch, including but not limited to failing to take reasonable steps to inspect, prune, or otherwise address it.  
21. Defendant’s breach of duty created an unreasonable risk of injury to Plaintiff and others lawfully traveling on the public sidewalk.  
22. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered physical injuries, incurred medical expenses in the amount of approximately $2,500, lost wages in the amount of approximately $600, and endured pain and suffering.
