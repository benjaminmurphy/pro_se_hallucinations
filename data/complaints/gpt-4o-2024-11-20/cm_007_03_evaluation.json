It does not involve or discuss any parent\u2019s health condition or an inability to safely care for the children, nor does it address modifying custody or parenting arrangements on that basis.

The appellate court actually reverses a change in custody because there was no valid material and substantial change in circumstances, and the change was improperly based on relocation alone.
