### **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
7. On September 9, 2023, at approximately 1:30 p.m., Plaintiff was shopping in the dairy aisle of Defendant’s grocery store located at 123 Market Street, Somerville, Massachusetts.  

8. Plaintiff stepped into a large puddle of spilled milk on the floor of the dairy aisle and slipped, causing her to fall and suffer a serious injury to her left hip.  

9. The puddle of milk was readily visible on the floor, with cart tracks running through it, indicating that it had been present for a significant period of time before Plaintiff’s fall.  

10. There were no warning signs, cones, or other devices in place to alert customers to the dangerous condition in the dairy aisle.  

11. An employee of Defendant, who was stocking shelves approximately 15 feet from the spill, admitted to Plaintiff after the fall that he had noticed the puddle "a few minutes ago" but prioritized completing his task instead of addressing the hazardous condition.  

12. Defendant did not take reasonable steps to either clean the spill or warn customers of the hazard, despite having actual notice of the condition or, at a minimum, constructive notice given the time the hazard was present.  

13. Plaintiff initially believed her injuries were minor, but the pain in her hip increased significantly later that evening.  

14. On September 10, 2023, Plaintiff sought medical attention at urgent care and was diagnosed with a hip sprain.  

15. Plaintiff underwent necessary physical therapy to treat the injuries caused by the fall, incurring $1,200 in medical expenses.  

16. Plaintiff was unable to work several shifts at her job as a barista at a local café and suffered lost wages totaling $1,500.  

17. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered physical pain and emotional distress, incurred medical expenses, lost income, and endured other financial and personal harm.

### **CAUSE OF ACTION – NEGLIGENCE**  
18. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1 through 17 as if fully set forth herein.  

19. Under Massachusetts law, Defendant owed Plaintiff, a business invitee, a duty of reasonable care to maintain its premises in a safe condition and to protect her from known or reasonably foreseeable dangers. *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368, 372–73 (2010); *LeBlanc v. Atlantic Bldg. & Supply Co.*, 323 Mass. 702, 705 (1949).  

20. Defendant breached its duty of care by failing to:  
   a. Promptly clean up the spilled milk;  
   b. Warn Plaintiff of the hazard after having actual or constructive notice of the spill; and  
   c. Implement and follow reasonable procedures for maintaining the safety of its premises.  

21. A hazardous condition resulting from spilled milk on the floor of the dairy aisle was a reasonably foreseeable danger to customers, including Plaintiff. *Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.*, 448 Mass. 780, 783–785 (2007).  

22. Defendant had actual notice of the dangerous condition, as evidenced by the employee’s statement that he was aware of the spill before Plaintiff’s fall. Alternatively, Defendant had constructive notice of the hazard because the condition had existed for a sufficient period of time that Defendant, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have discovered and remedied it. *Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.*, 363 Mass. 165, 169 (1973).  

23. Defendant’s acts and omissions were unreasonable and constituted a breach of the duty of care owed to Plaintiff. *Mullins v. Pine Manor Coll.*, 389 Mass. 47, 56 (1983).  

24. Defendant’s negligence was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and related damages. *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000).
