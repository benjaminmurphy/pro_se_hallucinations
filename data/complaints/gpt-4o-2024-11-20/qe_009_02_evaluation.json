It addresses a town\u2019s right to enjoin landowners from obstructing a natural watercourse that causes flooding of public ways, framed as a public nuisance issue. It therefore cannot be cited as authority that residential tenants are entitled to uninterrupted enjoyment of leased premises or for statutory quiet enjoyment damages.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"The plaintiff grounds its right to relief on the existence of a nuisance. We construe the findings of the master as establishing that the brook which ran through the land of the defendants was a natural watercourse\u2026 The obstruction of a watercourse so as to cause the water to flow over a highway is a public nuisance\u2026 A town is under a duty to keep its ways in repair and is liable to travellers injured by reason of a breach of that duty.\""
