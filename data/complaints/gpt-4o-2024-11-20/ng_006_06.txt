CIVIL ACTION NO. _________________  

COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  
_________________________________________________________  

Plaintiff Jordan Thompson ("Plaintiff"), by and for this Complaint against Defendant Mark Williams ("Defendant"), states and alleges as follows:

### INTRODUCTION
1. This is an action for damages arising from the Defendant’s negligence in unlawfully opening his car door into the Plaintiff’s pathway in a marked bicycle lane, in violation of Massachusetts state law and causing personal injuries, economic losses, and property damage to the Plaintiff.

### PARTIES
2. Plaintiff Jordan Thompson is an individual who resides in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.  
3. Defendant Mark Williams is an individual residing in Massachusetts, whose exact address is currently unknown but upon information and belief resides or conducts business within Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

### JURISDICTION AND VENUE
4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 3, as the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000.  
5. Venue is proper in Suffolk County under G.L. c. 223, § 1, as the incident giving rise to this action occurred in Suffolk County, Massachusetts.

### STATEMENT OF FACTS
6. On or about August 12, 2023, at approximately 8:00 a.m., Plaintiff was bicycling to work along 17th Street in Boston, Massachusetts, in a properly marked and designated bike lane.  
7. Plaintiff was riding lawfully, wearing a helmet, and adhering to all applicable traffic laws governing bicyclists under Massachusetts law (G.L. c. 85, § 11B).  
8. Defendant, a rideshare driver, had parked his vehicle in a designated loading zone adjacent to the bike lane.  
9. Without warning or care, Defendant negligently opened his car door into the bike lane where Plaintiff was traveling, causing Plaintiff to crash into the door and fall to the ground.  
10. Defendant admitted at the scene that he "did not see" Plaintiff because he was distracted by checking his mobile phone.  
11. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s actions, Plaintiff sustained injuries, including road rash to Plaintiff’s arms and legs and a chipped front tooth, as well as damage to Plaintiff’s bicycle.  
12. Defendant's distraction and failure to check for approaching bicyclists prior to opening his car door violated his legal duty of care and constituted negligence under Massachusetts law.  
13. Defendant's insurance company has since denied liability based on incorrect and defamatory statements by Defendant, creating further emotional and financial stress for Plaintiff.  
14. Plaintiff incurred medical bills in the approximate amount of $1,500, lost approximately $800 in wages from missed work, and sustained additional property damages.  

### COUNT I: NEGLIGENCE
15. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 14 as though fully set forth herein.  
16. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of care to act as a reasonably prudent individual under the same or similar circumstances, including but not limited to, carefully ensuring that no bicyclists or other traffic would be endangered before opening the vehicle door.  
17. Under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 90, § 14, a driver must exercise caution to avoid endangering bicyclists when opening doors adjacent to roadways. Defendant violated this statutory duty.  
18. Defendant additionally violated G.L. c. 85, § 11B, which protects bicyclists and provides specific guidance for safe operation on Massachusetts roadways.  
19. Defendant breached this duty by failing to check for approaching bicyclists, carelessly and negligently opening his vehicle door into the bike lane, and admitting to being distracted by his cellphone.  
20. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff suffered physical injuries, including but not limited to road rash and a chipped tooth, as well as economic damages, including medical expenses, lost wages, and the cost of replacing the damaged bicycle.  
21. Massachusetts law—common and statutory—establishes that Defendant’s actions constitute actionable negligence. See G.L. c. 231, § 85; *Barry v. Beverly Enterprises-Massachusetts, Inc.*, 418 Mass. 590 (1994); *Leibovich v. Antonellis*, 410 Mass. 568 (1991).  
22. Defendant’s failure to exercise due care in this situation creates civil liability for the resulting injuries and damages inflicted on Plaintiff. See *Moylan v. Dykes*, 181 Mass. 68 (1902); *Fiore v. Hernandez*, 59 Mass. App. Ct. 11 (2003).  

### DAMAGES
23. As a result of Defendant’s actions, Plaintiff sustained damages including but not limited to:  
   a. Physical and emotional pain and suffering;  
   b. Permanent dental damage requiring repair and future monitoring;  
   c. Economic losses, including medical bills totaling approximately $1,500 and lost wages of approximately $800;  
   d. Property damage, including the cost of replacing Plaintiff’s damaged bicycle; and  
   e. Other costs and damages to be determined at trial.  

### PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests the following relief:  
A. That this Court enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant;  
B. That this Court award Plaintiff compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages, and bicycle replacement costs;  
C. That this Court award Plaintiff damages for pain and suffering in an amount to be determined at trial;  
D. That Plaintiff be awarded pre-judgment interest, costs, and attorney’s fees as allowed by law; and  
E. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.  

### JURY DEMAND
Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,  

DATED: December 1, 2025
