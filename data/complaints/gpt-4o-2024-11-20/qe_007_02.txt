**INTRODUCTION**

1. This is a civil action brought by Plaintiff, Kevin Thompson, against Defendant, Lydia Grant, for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law. Plaintiff seeks damages resulting from the substantial and ongoing interference with the use and enjoyment of his residential rental property caused by Defendant’s actions and omissions.

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to M.G.L. c. 218, § 19, as the claims arise under Massachusetts landlord-tenant law.

5. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to M.G.L. c. 223, § 1, because the property that is the subject of this Complaint is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

6. On or about January 15, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a written lease agreement with Defendant to rent the residential unit located at 123 Maple Street, Apartment 2, Cambridge, MA 02139. Plaintiff currently resides in the premises under a month-to-month tenancy.  

7. Plaintiff pays $2,500.00 per month in rent to Defendant.  

8. In or around October 2025, Defendant began renovations on the unit adjacent to Plaintiff’s apartment.  

9. For the past two months, from October 2025 through December 2025, construction activities in the neighboring unit have caused incessant noise, including drilling, hammering, and loud discussions by workers. Construction typically occurs from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM on weekdays.  

10. Plaintiff works from home and is required to participate in work calls, attend virtual meetings, and perform professional tasks that require concentration and a quiet environment.  

11. The noise from the construction has made it extremely difficult for Plaintiff to perform his work duties, causing stress, frustration, and anxiety over his professional obligations.  

12. In addition to the noise, Plaintiff’s apartment has been affected by construction dust infiltrating his unit through the vents, further diminishing his ability to enjoy and use his rental property.  

13. Defendant verbally informed Plaintiff of the intended renovation prior to the start of construction. However, Defendant failed to take adequate steps to mitigate the disruption or provide meaningful accommodations beyond offering a nominal one-time $100 rent reduction.  

14. Defendant’s construction activities and failure to safeguard Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the premises violate Plaintiff’s rights under M.G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

15. As a direct result of Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiff has suffered a substantial interference with the use and enjoyment of his rental property.

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – M.G.L. c. 186, § 14**

16. Plaintiff restates and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 15 as if fully set forth herein.  

17. Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, every residential lease in Massachusetts includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, which guarantees that the tenant is entitled to use and enjoy the rented premises without substantial interference by the landlord.  

18. Defendant’s actions, including prolonged and disruptive construction noise and dusty conditions that infiltrate Plaintiff’s unit, constitute a violation of Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment.  

19. Massachusetts courts have held that substantial interference with a tenant’s ability to use and enjoy their rental premises violates M.G.L. c. 186, § 14. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 100 (1982); *Davis v. Jones*, 532 N.E.2d 299, 300 (Mass. App. Ct. 1988).  

20. Defendant’s failure to mitigate the disruption caused by the construction amounts to a clear breach of the statutory covenant. See *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847, 851-52 (1997).  

21. Defendant’s offer of a $100 rent reduction is not an adequate remedy for the ongoing and significant interference Plaintiff has experienced. See *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994) (nominal remedies inadequate where substantial interference exists).  

22. Defendant’s substantial interference has caused Plaintiff to suffer economic and non-economic damages, including loss of enjoyment of the premises, diminished productivity, emotional distress, and other consequential harms.  

23. Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, a tenant whose quiet enjoyment rights are violated is entitled to recover actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus attorney’s fees and costs.

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Kevin Thompson respectfully requests that this Court grant the following relief:  

A. Award Plaintiff actual damages in the amount of $1,500.00 to compensate for the substantial loss of quiet enjoyment and interference with his use of the premises, or alternatively, three months’ rent in the amount of $7,500.00, pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186, § 14;  

B. Award Plaintiff the costs of this action, including reasonable attorney’s fees, pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186, § 14;  

C. Enter such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
