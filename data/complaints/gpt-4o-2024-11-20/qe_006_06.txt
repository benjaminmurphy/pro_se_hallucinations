### FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

6. On or about January 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a written rental agreement with Defendant to lease the Premises at 250 Main St., Brockton, MA 02301.  

7. Plaintiff agreed to pay monthly rent of $1,200 under the terms of the lease, which she has continuously paid in full and on time.  

8. On or about November 10, 2025, the hot water in the Premises ceased to function. Plaintiff promptly reported this issue to Defendant the same day.  

9. Defendant informed Plaintiff that the water heater required a replacement part, which he claimed to have ordered.  

10. Despite Plaintiff's multiple follow-up communications with Defendant, the issue has still not been resolved as of the date of this Complaint, December 1, 2025.  

11. For over three weeks, Plaintiff has been without functional hot water in the Premises, which represents a serious and material impairment of the leasehold premises for residential purposes.  

12. Plaintiff has incurred significant inconvenience as a result of Defendant’s failure to resolve the hot water issue, including having to shower at a gym, incurring $30 in monthly gym fees and additional transportation costs, and being unable to provide adequate bathing facilities for her infant daughter, requiring her to travel to her mother’s house.  

13. Despite Defendant's knowledge of the issue, his actions in failing to supply hot water amount to a violation of Plaintiff’s statutory right to quiet enjoyment of the Premises under G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

14. As a result of Defendant’s actions and inactions, Plaintiff has suffered damages, including but not limited to:  
   a. Out-of-pocket expenses;  
   b. Disruption of daily living;  
   c. Severe inconvenience and discomfort.

### CAUSE OF ACTION  

**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14**  

15. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth herein.  

16. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Massachusetts law provides that tenants are entitled to the quiet enjoyment of their rental premises, and any interference therewith caused by the landlord’s breach of duty is unlawful.  

17. Defendant’s failure to promptly and adequately address the lack of hot water constitutes an outright interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.  

18. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff may recover damages for any violation of her right to quiet enjoyment, which includes the failure to provide services essential to habitability, such as hot water.  

19. The provision of hot water is a fundamental element of habitability in residential tenancies. Defendant’s prolonged failure to resolve the issue has materially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of her home.  

20. Defendant’s failure to restore hot water violates applicable Massachusetts laws, including but not limited to:  

   a. G.L. c. 186, § 14 (covenant of quiet enjoyment);  
   b. G.L. c. 239, § 8A;  
   c. G.L. c. 111, § 127L (sanitary conditions in rental housing).  

21. Plaintiff has suffered actual and consequential damages as a result of Defendant’s violation of her right to quiet enjoyment.  

22. Defendant’s ongoing failure to address the lack of hot water shows a pattern of nonresponsiveness and neglect inconsistent with his legal obligations under Massachusetts law.  

23. Plaintiff is entitled to damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14, which permits recovery of actual damages or three times the monthly rent, whichever is greater.

1. Actual damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but not less than $600;  

2. Treble damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14;  

3. Costs incurred in this action, including reasonable attorney’s fees if applicable;
