Although the court ultimately bases the tenant\u2019s substantial recovery on breach of the implied warranty of habitability and on emotional distress and c. 93A, the opinion accepts the Housing Court\u2019s determination that the tenant prevailed on a counterclaim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and treats the landlord\u2019s failure to correct the grave conditions as actionable. Thus, it supports the general proposition that a landlord\u2019s failure to address significant habitability problems can constitute a breach of quiet enjoyment, even though the quiet enjoyment analysis is not elaborated in detail.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "After a trial, a judge of the Housing Court found in favor of Gonzalez on all of her counterclaims and awarded her damages under c. 186, treble damages under c. 93A (for the intentional infliction of emotional distress and violation of the warranty of habitability), and attorneys' fees and costs. \u2026 After his view, the judge made express findings. Among other defects, the judge found that: (1) there was no functioning heating system; \u2026 (8) the apartment was infested with cockroaches and rodents. \u2026 The judge ordered Haddad to repair most of the defects\u2026 [but] the inspector found that virtually all of the defects\u2026 remained unrepaired."

The court affirms a jury verdict for breach of the implied warranty of habitability and holds that repeated flooding interfering with sanitary conditions supports both habitability and statutory quiet enjoyment claims (though the quiet enjoyment damages award was vacated as duplicative, not for lack of liability). While mold is not mentioned, water damage and unsanitary flooding are recognized as sufficient bases for these claims.",

It does not concern landlord\u2011tenant law, conditions of residential premises, water leaks, or any claim under G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 14.

It states that by renting a dwelling, the landlord impliedly agrees that it complies with those standards and will be maintained accordingly, and that this obligation is interdependent with the tenant\u2019s duty to pay rent. That directly supports the proposition that landlords must maintain habitable conditions in rental units.",

      "support_reasoning": "The opinion discusses sanitary code violations and awards damages for breach of the warranty of habitability and related statutory violations, but it does not analyze or even mention a covenant of quiet enjoyment claim. The court characterizes most conditions as having a \u2018minimal impact\u2019 and focuses only on rent abatement and statutory remedies, not on whether persistent failure to address hazards constitutes a breach of quiet enjoyment. Thus, it does not provide authority for the specific quiet-enjoyment proposition stated.",
