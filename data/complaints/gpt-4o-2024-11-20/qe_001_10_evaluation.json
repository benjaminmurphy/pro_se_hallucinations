The court reaffirms the implied warranty of habitability (with reference to Boston Housing Authority v. Hemingway and Crowell v. McCaffrey) and holds the landlord liable for flooding conditions that violated the sanitary code, interfered with quiet enjoyment under G.L. c.186 \u00a714, and caused compensable personal and emotional injuries. This fits the proposition that substantial interference with use and enjoyment is actionable under Massachusetts law.",

Further, a landlord that fails to maintain a habitable dwelling for its tenant is liable for resulting personal injuries, at least when the landlord has failed to exercise reasonable care in maintenance.\u2026 Finally, Gem is liable to Solomon under \u00a7 14 because it violated its underlying duty to maintain sanitary conditions in her apartment, and thereby permitted repeated flooding to occur that interfered with her quiet enjoyment of her apartment.\u201d"

L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (16). The defendant, Browning-Ferris Industries, Inc. (Mass.) (BFI), appeals from a jury verdict that it unlawfully fired the plaintiff, Brian A. Dartt, because of a handicap, an earlier work-related injury to his back."
