**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

7. Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a lease agreement for a residential apartment located at 123 Main Street, Brockton, MA 02301, starting on January 1, 2022. Plaintiff pays Defendant $1,450 per month in rent.  

8. On or about November 10, 2025, the hot water in Plaintiff's apartment ceased functioning, rendering Plaintiff unable to properly use the apartment's facilities for bathing, washing dishes, and other ordinary household activities that require hot water.  

9. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant on November 10, 2025, of the issue, as required under Massachusetts law, and Defendant acknowledged the complaint, explaining that the water heater required a replacement part.  

10. Over the following three weeks, Plaintiff repeatedly followed up with Defendant regarding the status of the repairs, and while Defendant regularly responded to Plaintiff’s inquiries, he failed to address the issue in a timely manner.  

11. As of December 1, 2025, nearly a month has passed, and the hot water in the apartment has not been restored.  

12. Due to the continued lack of hot water, Plaintiff has been forced to make alternative arrangements for bathing and washing dishes, including paying $30 per month for a gym membership to shower and incurring additional gas expenses for travel. Plaintiff has also incurred inconvenience and hardship by having to bathe her infant at a relative’s home.  

13. The lack of hot water has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the rental property, rendering it uninhabitable for ordinary purposes and violating Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law.  

14. Plaintiff provided Defendant with repeated opportunities to address the issue, but Defendant failed to restore hot water to the apartment within a reasonable time, constituting a breach of the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment.  

15. As a result of Defendant’s actions and inactions, Plaintiff has suffered damages, including, but not limited to, out-of-pocket expenses, inconvenience, and emotional distress, and is entitled to compensation for these losses.

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – M.G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  

16. Plaintiff reaffirms and incorporates by reference each of the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  

17. Under **M.G.L. c. 186, § 14**, every landlord covenants that tenants have the right to quiet enjoyment of their rental premises, free from substantial interference by the landlord or from conditions that make the premises unsuitable for their intended use.  

18. The lack of hot water in the rental unit for nearly a month constitutes a substantial and unreasonable interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the property.  

19. Defendant’s failure to ensure the timely repair of the water heater constitutes a violation of his statutory obligation to provide suitable housing in compliance with Massachusetts law.  

20. Massachusetts caselaw clearly establishes that the non-functionality of essential utilities, including hot water, constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See **Lowery v. Robinson**, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 982 (1982), and **Dartt v. Browning-Ferris Industries, Inc.**, 427 Mass. 1 (1998).  

21. Defendant’s breach of his obligations under **M.G.L. c. 186, § 14** entitles Plaintiff to recover statutory damages, actual damages, and attorneys’ fees. Under the statute, Plaintiff is also entitled to 3 months’ rent as damages or actual damages, whichever is greater, due to Defendant’s knowing violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  

22. Defendant’s conduct was intentional or grossly negligent, as he failed to restore a critical utility despite repeated notice from Plaintiff and a prolonged period to make the necessary repairs.

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grant judgment in her favor and award the following relief:  

A. An award of actual damages, including but not limited to $500, covering Plaintiff’s out-of-pocket expenses, inconvenience, and emotional distress.  

B. Statutory damages of three months’ rent, totaling $4,350, pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

C. An award of attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in bringing this action, as provided by M.G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

D. Any such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

**DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL**  

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
