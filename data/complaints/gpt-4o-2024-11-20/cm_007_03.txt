**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

**Introduction**  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Emily Carter, and respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the existing custody order in this case to reflect a significant change in circumstances that has arisen since the entry of the prior order. This Complaint is brought pursuant to *M.G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 31*, along with applicable Massachusetts family law and case law supporting modification of custody orders to serve the best interests of the child.  

In support of this Complaint, the Plaintiff states as follows:

1.3. The Plaintiff and Defendant are the parents of the following minor child:

---

**2. Jurisdiction and Venue**  

2.1. This Complaint for Modification is filed in the Bristol Probate and Family Court, which has jurisdiction over matters concerning custody and parenting orders under *M.G.L. c. 215, § 3*.  

2.2. The original custody and parenting time order was issued by this Court on May 10, 2018.  

---

**3. Relevant Background**  

3.1. Pursuant to the Court’s order of May 10, 2018, the parties share physical custody of their daughter Sophie Carter on a 50/50 basis, alternating weeks.  

3.2. At the time the original order was issued, both parties were in good health, lived in close proximity to one another, and were able to fully participate in parenting responsibilities.  

3.3. This previous arrangement worked well for several years, as the child was able to maintain consistent routines in both homes.  

---

**4. Material Change in Circumstances**  

4.1. Since the issuance of the original order, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances concerning the Defendant’s health and his ability to safely exercise shared physical custody of the parties’ child.  

4.2. The Defendant has been diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition, which has significantly impacted his mobility and ability to provide safe supervision for the minor child.  

4.3. The Defendant’s health condition has led to repeated falls at home, significant physical limitations, and a recommendation from the Defendant’s medical provider that he should not be alone with the child near stairs or in situations requiring a quick physical response.  

4.4. Despite these medical limitations, the Defendant has continued to insist on maintaining the existing 50/50 custody arrangement and, at times, has relied on the minor child, Sophie, to assist with tasks such as helping him from a wheelchair to bed or retrieving items for him.  

4.5. As a result of the Defendant’s condition, the minor child has faced increased emotional stress, a lack of stability, and safety concerns while in the Defendant’s care.  

4.6. The above circumstances constitute a material change in conditions since the original custody order and require this Court’s intervention to ensure the minor child’s safety and welfare, consistent with her best interests under *M.G.L. c. 208, § 28.*  

---

**5. Legal Standard and Best Interests of the Child**  

5.1. Under Massachusetts law, custody orders may be modified based on a material and substantial change in circumstances, provided the modification serves the best interests of the child. See *M.G.L. c. 208, § 28; Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996); Rollins v. Rollins, 55 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (2002).*  

5.2. The Massachusetts courts have long prioritized the safety, welfare, and developmental needs of the child when determining custody arrangements. See *Bezio v. Patenaude, 381 Mass. 563 (1980); Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).*  

5.3. Courts are empowered to modify custody and parenting arrangements where one parent’s health condition prevents them from safely caring for the child. See *Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).*  

5.4. In determining the best interests of the child, Massachusetts courts consider factors such as the stability of the child’s environment, the ability of the parents to provide for the child’s safety, and the impact on the child’s emotional well-being. See *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).*  

5.5. The Plaintiff asserts that the Defendant’s current health limitations render him unable to provide a safe and stable environment for the child, and a modification to a primary physical custody arrangement in favor of the Plaintiff is warranted to protect the child’s best interests.

**6. Request for Modification**  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Emily Carter, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

a. Find that a material and substantial change in circumstances exists to warrant modification of the current custody and parenting order.  

b. Issue an order granting the Plaintiff primary physical custody of Sophie Carter, with parenting time for the Defendant to be adjusted in accordance with his health and abilities.  

c. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

Respectfully submitted,
