This opinion squarely addresses that statute, explains the scope of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, and holds that the tenants stated a viable \u00a7 14 claim based on serious interference with their tenancy caused by drug activity and the landlord\u2019s omissions. The court reverses summary judgment on the quiet enjoyment claim and confirms that tenants may obtain damages and injunctive relief under \u00a7 14, so the case is accurately cited for that principle.",

L. c. 186, \u00a7 14.\u201d"

      "support_reasoning": "The opinion squarely holds that a landlord can be liable for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, amounting to constructive eviction, where the disturbance arises from another tenant\u2019s operations that the landlord had the right and ability to control. The court emphasizes that the landlords created the situation by leasing to the lounge, had contractual control over the lounge\u2019s noise, and therefore could be held responsible for that third party\u2019s conduct. This aligns with the proposition that Blackett establishes landlord liability for quiet enjoyment breaches caused by third-party actions the landlord can control.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cBecause the disturbing condition was the natural and probable consequence of the landlords\u2019 permitting the lounge to operate where it did and because the landlords could control the actions at the lounge, they should not be entitled to collect rent for residential premises which were not reasonably habitable. Tenants such as these should not be left only with a claim against the proprietors of the noisome lounge\u2026 we decline to perpetuate that distinction where the landlord creates a situation and has the right to control the objectionable conditions.\u201d"

In addressing Gem\u2019s argument that third-party tenant conduct caused the flooding, the court explicitly states that this was a preventable situation that the landlord had a duty to prevent and affirms liability under G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 14. While the \u201cdisturbances\u201d here are environmental (flooding/sewage) rather than, for example, noisy neighbors, the opinion does hold landlords accountable for ongoing, preventable interferences with a tenant\u2019s occupancy.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cAs its third objection to Solomon\u2019s recovery on her count for interference with quiet enjoyment, Gem asserts that it was wrongly held responsible for the actions of third parties beyond its control\u2026 Gem argues that it was unable to control the source of the flooding. \u2026 This contention echoes Gem\u2019s objections to the verdict for reckless infliction of emotional distress, and we reject it for the same reasons. The water in Solomon\u2019s apartment was a preventable situation, and one that Gem had a duty to prevent. \u2026 Therefore, Gem is liable to Solomon under G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14.\u201d"
