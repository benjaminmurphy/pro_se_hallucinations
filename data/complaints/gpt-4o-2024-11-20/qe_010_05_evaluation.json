As we read the cases cited infra, the warranty of habitability does not require, by itself, that the landlord provide security guards or other police services, because such services in no way relate to the maintenance or repair of the physical facilities vital to the use of the premises.\u201d"

Haddad v. Gonzalez focuses on broad habitability defects (heat, structural disrepair, infestations) and emotional distress/Chapter 93A damages; it does not establish a specific rule that the presence of mold and refusal to remediate, as such, violate Massachusetts housing laws. Thus, citing this case for a mold\u2011specific legal standard overstates its holding.",

On the G.L. c. 93A counterclaim, the judge found that Gonzalez had suffered two discrete injuries as a consequence of Haddad's unfair and deceptive trade practices: emotional distress, and the diminution in value of the apartment due to Haddad's breach of the warranty of habitability.\u201d"

The justice proposes that landlords have an implied contractual obligation, derived from statutes and codes, to maintain premises to minimum standards, and that this obligation be mutually interdependent with rent, but he does not frame it as strict liability for quiet enjoyment violations.
