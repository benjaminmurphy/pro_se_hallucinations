Civil Action No. ___________  

**COMPLAINT**  

**INTRODUCTION**  

1. This is a negligence action arising from injuries sustained by Plaintiff Jessica Turner on February 15, 2023, at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts, due to Defendant Anna Brooks’s failure to maintain the sidewalk adjoining her property in a reasonably safe condition.  

2. Plaintiff seeks damages for medical expenses, lost wages, physical pain and suffering, and other actual losses caused by Defendant’s negligence.  

**PARTIES**  

3. Plaintiff, Jessica Turner, is an individual residing in Worcester County, Massachusetts.  

4. Defendant, Anna Brooks, is an individual who owns and controls the residential property located at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts, 01603.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

5. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, as the damages exceed $25,000.  

6. Venue is proper in Worcester County pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1, as the events giving rise to the cause of action occurred in Worcester, Massachusetts.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

7. Defendant Anna Brooks owns, operates, and is responsible for maintaining the premises at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, including the sidewalk abutting the property, in a reasonably safe condition for lawful visitors and others lawfully present.  

8. Pursuant to Worcester City Ordinance, Chapter 12, Section 35 and G.L. c. 84, § 1, Defendant is obligated to clear snow and ice from the sidewalk adjoining her property to ensure it is safe for use.  

9. On February 13, 2023, a significant snowstorm occurred, depositing several inches of snow on the sidewalks at and near 123 Maple Street, Worcester.  

10. Defendant shoveled a narrow path down the middle of the sidewalk but failed to apply salt, sand, or other ice-melting products, leaving the pathway untreated.  

11. Over the next two days, the untreated portion of the sidewalk became dangerously icy due to daytime thawing and nighttime refreezing of the snow and ice.  

12. On February 15, 2023, Plaintiff Jessica Turner was lawfully on the premises delivering groceries to a tenant of the building.  

13. While walking on the sidewalk adjoining 123 Maple Street, Plaintiff slipped on the untreated sheet of ice and fell backward, landing hard on her lower back.  

14. As a direct result of this fall, Plaintiff sustained a serious lower back injury that required medical treatment and caused her to miss approximately one week of work.  

15. Prior to Plaintiff’s fall, tenants of the building had informed Defendant of the dangerous condition on the sidewalk, including texting photographs of the ice. Defendant responded, “the sun will take care of it,” thereby knowingly disregarding the hazard.  

16. Defendant failed to take reasonable steps to remediate the ice, including but not limited to sanding, salting, or otherwise making the sidewalk safe for lawful visitors such as Plaintiff.  

17. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has incurred medical expenses totaling approximately $2,500, lost wages of approximately $1,000, and endured physical pain and suffering.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  

**Count I: Negligence**  

18. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 17 of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein.  

19. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of care to maintain the sidewalk adjoining 123 Maple Street in a reasonably safe condition, free of hazards such as snow and ice, and to comply with applicable laws and ordinances governing snow and ice removal. (See *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368 (2010); G.L. c. 84, § 1.)  

20. Defendant breached this duty by failing to properly address the untreated ice on the sidewalk despite being aware of the dangerous condition and the foreseeable risk of harm to lawful visitors.  

21. Defendant’s failure to maintain the sidewalk was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff’s injuries.  

22. Defendant’s conduct was negligent in that she:  
   a. Failed to properly salt, sand, or otherwise treat the sidewalk;  
   b. Disregarded complaints from tenants and failed to act upon their warnings;  
   c. Failed to comply with Worcester City Ordinances regarding snow and ice removal; and  
   d. Acted in a manner that unreasonably endangered lawful visitors, including Plaintiff.  

23. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained injuries, incurred monetary losses, and endured physical pain and emotional suffering to her detriment.

1. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, including but not limited to:  
   a. Past and future medical expenses;

2. Pre- and post-judgment interest as allowed by law pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B and § 6C.
