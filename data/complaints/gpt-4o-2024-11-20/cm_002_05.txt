*Plaintiff,*  
v.  
**Michael Davis,**  
*Defendant.*  

### **COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**

**NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Taylor, and respectfully states the following for her Complaint for Modification of Custody Order pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 215, § 6:**

---

### **1. Preliminary Statement**

This is a Complaint for Modification filed in accordance with Massachusetts law to address a material and substantial change in circumstances that has occurred since the original custody order was entered by this Court on March 15, 2021. Specifically, the Defendant, Michael Davis, now intends to relocate to New Hampshire for employment, which significantly alters the viability of the parenting schedule currently in place and creates substantial disruptions and harm to the parties' minor child, resulting in the need for the custody and visitation arrangements to be modified.

---

### **2. Parties**

1. **Plaintiff:** Jessica Taylor resides in Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts. She is the mother of the minor child, Sophie Davis, and has primary physical custody under the existing order.
   
2. **Defendant:** Michael Davis resides in Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, but has expressed his intent to move to New Hampshire for employment reasons. He is the father of the minor child, Sophie Davis.

3. **Minor Child:** Sophie Davis, born June 12, 2017, is eight years old and is attending school and extracurricular activities in Cambridge.

---

### **3. Jurisdiction and Venue**

1. Jurisdiction is proper under G.L. c. 208, § 28 because this matter concerns the custody of a minor child, who resides in Massachusetts.

2. Venue is proper in the Middlesex Probate and Family Court pursuant to G.L. c. 215, § 6 because the original custody order was entered in this Court, and the Plaintiff and child continue to reside in Middlesex County.

---

### **4. Procedural Background**

1. On March 15, 2021, this Court issued a custody order in Docket No. [Docket Number to Be Added], granting primary physical custody of Sophie Davis to the Plaintiff, Jessica Taylor, with parenting time allocated to the Defendant, Michael Davis, on Wednesdays and every other weekend.

2. The custody and visitation schedule in the 2021 order was based on both parents residing within close proximity in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where the minor child also attends school and participates in extracurricular activities.

---

### **5. Material Change in Circumstances**

1. On or about November 1, 2025, the Defendant informed the Plaintiff of his intent to relocate to New Hampshire for a job opportunity. This relocation represents a significant material change in circumstances because:
   - The relocation introduces a travel distance of approximately 90 minutes (each way) between Cambridge, where Sophie resides, and the Defendant’s new residence in New Hampshire.
   - The Wednesday overnight parenting schedule is no longer practicable as it would require Sophie to endure lengthy commutes on school nights, interfering with her education, sleep, and extracurricular activities.

2. Since learning of the Defendant’s intent to relocate, Sophie, who is eight years old, has expressed anxiety about the prospect of lengthy commutes, as well as concern about missing after-school activities and other routines that are critical to her well-being.

3. The Plaintiff contends that maintaining the current custody and visitation schedule in light of the Defendant’s relocation would not serve Sophie’s best interests, as defined under G.L. c. 208, § 28. The proposed schedule no longer supports her stability, education, physical health, or emotional well-being.

---

### **6. Relief Requested**

1. The Plaintiff requests that this Court find the Defendant’s relocation to New Hampshire constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances warranting modification of the existing custody and parenting-time order.

2. The Plaintiff requests that the Wednesday overnight visitations be removed from the Defendant's parenting schedule and that the Defendant’s alternate weekend visitations be adjusted to a schedule more compatible with the increased distance between the parties’ residences.

3. The Plaintiff submits that this modification is necessary and consistent with the best interests of the child as interpreted under Massachusetts law, including *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985) and *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).

---

### **7. Legal Grounds**

This Complaint is supported by Massachusetts law, which allows modification of a custody order upon a showing of a material change in circumstances and emphasizes that the best interests of the child are the paramount concern. Specifically:

1. Under **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, the Court may modify custody orders when a material change in circumstances occurs, and the modification is in the child’s best interests. See *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488, 493-494 (2012).

2. A relocation by one parent constitutes a material change in circumstances when it disrupts the child’s life and the intended parenting schedule. See *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 711-712 (1985); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 181-182 (2006).

3. The Court has consistently found that lengthy travel times and disruptions to school routines are detrimental to a child’s well-being. See *Ducharme v. Ducharme*, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 52, 59-60 (2015); *Mickelson v. Barnet*, 49 Mass. App. Ct. 604, 609 (2000).

4. Sophie's expressed anxiety and disruption to her school and extracurricular activities further demonstrate that the current arrangement no longer serves her best interests. See *R.H. v. B.F.*, 102 Mass. App. Ct. 508, 514 (2023).

5. This modification is consistent with Massachusetts law, which favors stability, continuity, and the minimization of harm to the child. See *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540, 548 (2010); *El Chaar v. Chehab*, 78 Mass. App. Ct. 501, 503-506 (2010).

### **8. Prayer for Relief**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Taylor, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Find that the Defendant’s relocation to New Hampshire constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances warranting modification of the existing custody and parenting-time order;

2. Modify the existing custody and parenting-time order to eliminate the Wednesday overnight parenting time and restructure the alternate weekend schedule to reflect the realities of the increased travel distance;

3. Grant such other and further relief as is just and proper in the best interests of the minor child.
