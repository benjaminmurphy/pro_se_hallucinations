**In the Matter of:**  
**Rachel Bennett, Plaintiff**  
v.  
**David Carter, Defendant**  
**________________________________________**  

**PLAINTIFF'S COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Rachel Bennett, and respectfully submits this Complaint for Modification of the current custody and parenting time arrangements with respect to the minor child of the parties, Sophie Carter, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and related statutes. For reasons set forth below, Plaintiff contends that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the original custody order was entered on June 15, 2021, such that modification of the court-ordered parenting schedule is necessary and in the best interests of the minor child.  

**I. PARTIES**  
1. Plaintiff, Rachel Bennett, resides at [address withheld for privacy] and is the custodial parent of the minor child, Sophie Carter.  
2. Defendant, David Carter, resides at [address withheld for privacy] and is the non-custodial parent of the minor child.  

**II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter under G.L. c. 209C, § 20 and G.L. c. 208, § 28. Venue is proper in Middlesex Probate and Family Court, as this is the court that issued the original custody order, and substantial connections remain between the Court and the parties or subject matter.  

**III. ORIGINAL CUSTODY ORDER**  
4. The original custody order, entered on June 15, 2021, granted Plaintiff primary physical custody of the minor child, Sophie Carter, and awarded Defendant parenting time consisting of visitation every Wednesday overnight and every other weekend.  

**IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
5. At the time of the order, both Plaintiff and Defendant lived in close proximity to one another in the Cambridge area, and the parenting schedule was created based on the assumption that the parties would continue to live locally and the child would attend a nearby school in Cambridge.  
6. Defendant has recently accepted a new job in New Hampshire and is preparing to relocate there, creating a significant distance of approximately 90 minutes' drive each way from Sophie's current home and school in Cambridge.  
7. Defendant wants to maintain the same midweek overnight schedule, in which Sophie would travel to New Hampshire after school on Wednesdays, stay overnight, and return to school early Thursday morning. This would subject Sophie to multiple long drives during the school week.  
8. Sophie has already expressed anxiety and distress about the long drives and how they interfere with her after-school activities and preparedness for school. Sophie participates in [specific after-school activities], which are adversely impacted by this midweek disruption.  
9. This significant change in Defendant's residence and the proposed continuation of a midweek overnight schedule have created a material and substantial change in circumstances such that the current parenting plan no longer serves Sophie's best interests and needs.  
10. The Plaintiff believes that modifying the schedule to remove the midweek overnights and adjust the weekend parenting time to better reflect the geographic relocation is in Sophie's best interests.  

**V. JUSTIFICATION FOR MODIFICATION**  
11. Under Massachusetts law, the standard for modification of a custody order is demonstrating that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred, and that the modification is necessary in the child's best interests. *See Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 710 (1985); *Schechter v. Schechter*, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239, 244 (2015).  
12. The Defendant's move to New Hampshire and the associated increased distance between the parents’ homes constitute a significant material change in circumstances. *See Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 261 (2001).  
13. The best interests of the child are the paramount standard in all custody and parenting time adjudications. *G.L. c. 208, § 31*; *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488, 494 (2012).  
14. It is well established that parenting plans must be realistic, conducive to maintaining continuity in the child’s education, and supportive of the child’s emotional and physical health. *See Ardizoni v. Raymond*, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734, 738 (1996).  
15. Forcing a 9-year-old child to endure long drives during the school week is contrary to her educational and emotional well-being, particularly where it results in diminished participation in extracurricular activities, interrupted sleep, and increased anxiety. *See Altomare v. Altomare*, 77 Mass. App. Ct. 601, 607 (2010).  
16. Courts have consistently modified parenting orders based on geographic relocations that require significant adjustments to ensure the child’s routine and stability are prioritized. *See Pizzino v. Miller*, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 349, 354 (2006); *Hewitt v. Hewitt*, 74 Mass. App. Ct. 1116 (2009) (unpublished).  
17. Plaintiff’s request to revise the schedule by eliminating midweek overnight visitation and adjusting the weekend schedule seeks to promote Sophie’s best interests, maintaining her stability and ability to participate fully in her educational and extracurricular activities.  

**VI. REQUESTED MODIFICATION**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Rachel Bennett, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  
1. Eliminate the midweek overnight parenting time currently scheduled for Wednesdays.  
2. Adjust the Defendant’s weekend parenting schedule to account for the increased travel time between his home and Sophie’s home and school, such as providing full-weekend visits every other weekend or other arrangements the Court deems equitable.  
3. Award any other relief this Court deems just and proper.  

Respectfully submitted,
