While the court does not explicitly use the words \u201cnegligent or unreasonable,\u201d it grounds liability in failure to maintain sanitary, watertight premises and in unreasonable inaction in the face of known flooding, which is conceptually consistent with negligent or unreasonable interference with use and enjoyment.",
