      "support_reasoning": "The provided excerpt is a concurring opinion discussing the abandonment of common-law classifications of entrants (invitee, licensee, trespasser) in premises liability, and criticizing continued reliance on these categories. It does not recite or endorse the traditional invitee-specific duty to maintain premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of known or reasonably knowable hazards. Although the majority opinion in Mounsey does address occupier duties, the quoted concurring passage itself does not clearly support the specific invitee-duty formulation stated in the proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"The court holds that the measure of responsibility of an occupier should no longer depend on whether the injured person is characterized as a \u2018licensee\u2019 rather than an \u2018invitee,\u2019 or vice versa; the question is to turn on other, more vital factors. But footnote 7 seems to say that \u2018trespassers\u2019 stand apart, that that characterization is to remain decisive or highly influential.\""

Therefore, this case does not support the proposition about failing to inspect or correct hazardous shelving conditions.",

That necessarily encompasses the duty to implement precautionary measures or warnings about foreseeable risks (such as falling or spilled merchandise) once the owner has actual or constructive knowledge of those risks. The court frames the key factual question as whether the owner took adequate steps to forestall foreseeable injuries stemming from its mode of operation.",

The judge concludes the evidence was insufficient on causation and that verdicts should have been directed for defendants, which is the opposite of the claimed proposition that defendant\u2019s negligence directly and proximately caused plaintiff\u2019s injuries and related damages. Thus, this citation does not support the stated causation proposition.",
