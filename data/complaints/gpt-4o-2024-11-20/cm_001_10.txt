Defendant.

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**  

**Introduction**

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Lisa McKenzie, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, and respectfully moves this Honorable Court to modify its prior Custody and Parenting Time Order entered on May 15, 2020, concerning the minor children, Emma Johnson (born August 12, 2017) and Noah Johnson (born September 5, 2019). The Plaintiff avers that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the prior order such that modification is in the best interests of the minor children.

**Parties**

1. **Plaintiff**, Lisa McKenzie, resides at 45 Green Street, Somerville, MA, and has primary custody of both minor children as per the prior court order. Contact: (617) 555-0123; email: psm1443@gmail.com.
   
2. **Defendant**, Mark Johnson, resides at 78 Main Street, Somerville, MA, and has parenting time pursuant to the May 15, 2020 Order.

---

**Jurisdiction and Venue**

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 209C, §§ 3, 10, and G.L. c. 208, § 28, as the children reside in Massachusetts, and this Court issued the prior Custody Order.

4. Venue is appropriate in the Somerville Probate and Family Court as the parties and minor children reside within Middlesex County.

**Factual Allegations**

5. On May 15, 2020, the Court entered an Order establishing the current parenting schedule. Plaintiff was awarded primary custody, and Defendant was granted parenting time every other weekend from Friday evening through Sunday evening and one overnight during the week.

6. At the time of the prior Order, both Plaintiff and Defendant worked regular daytime jobs that allowed the Defendant to exercise his parenting time per the schedule without issue.

7. On or about January 2025, Defendant began working a new job with overnight shifts between 7:00 PM and 7:00 AM on multiple nights each week, including many of his assigned parenting overnights.

8. Since starting this job, Defendant has frequently failed to adequately exercise his parenting time and has left the children in situations that are not in their best interests, including but not limited to:
   - Dropping the children off at Plaintiff’s home with little to no advance notice because he was too exhausted from his overnight shifts.
   - Leaving the children in the care of his roommate, an individual whom Plaintiff does not know and whose qualifications to care for young children are unknown.
   - Allowing the children to fall asleep on the couch, unsupervised, while Defendant naps after long overnight shifts.

9. The children, Emma (8) and Noah (6), have expressed feelings of instability and discomfort due to these circumstances, reporting that they frequently feel anxious when Defendant is unavailable during his scheduled time.

10. Plaintiff has consistently and willingly adjusted her schedule as necessary to care for the children when Defendant is unavailable, but the current arrangement has become untenable and creates undue stress for both Plaintiff and the children.

11. A modification of the parenting schedule is necessary to reflect Defendant's current work schedule and to ensure the children's well-being and stability.

**Legal Basis for Modification**

12. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, a Custody Order may be modified upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the children. See *Knott v. Knott*, 441 Mass. 754, 758 (2004).

13. Massachusetts courts have consistently held that the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration in modification proceedings. See *Bezio v. Patenaude*, 381 Mass. 563, 576 (1980); *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488, 494 (2012).

14. A parent’s inability to provide stable care due to changes in employment and/or personal circumstances constitutes a material change in circumstances justifying modification of custody or visitation arrangements. See *Schechter v. Schechter*, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239, 248 (2015); *E.N.O. v. L.M.M.*, 429 Mass. 824, 829–30 (1999).

15. The Massachusetts Appeals Court has emphasized the importance of ensuring that a child’s custodial environment provides stability and consistency. See *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 711 (1985); *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 403 (1981).

16. Modification is also warranted where a parent routinely violates the terms of a prior custody arrangement, resulting in instability for the children. See *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590, 596 (1996); *Houle v. Houle*, 38 Mass. App. Ct. 638, 641 (1995).

17. Defendant’s work schedule, frequent failure to exercise parenting time, and reliance on third parties who are not vetted or familiar to the Plaintiff, constitute a significant and ongoing material change in circumstances. See *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 259 (2001); G.L. c. 208, § 28.

**Relief Requested**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Modify the existing Custody and Parenting Time Order to:
   a. Limit Defendant’s overnight parenting time to dates when he is not scheduled to work his overnight shifts.
   b. Require Defendant to notify Plaintiff at least 48 hours in advance if he is unable to exercise his scheduled parenting time.
   c. Prohibit Defendant from leaving the children in the care of third parties without written consent from Plaintiff, except in cases of emergency.

2. Award such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
