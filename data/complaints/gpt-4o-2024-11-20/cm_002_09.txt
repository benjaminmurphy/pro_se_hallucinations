**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**  

**INTRODUCTION**  

NOW COMES Sarah Thompson (the "Plaintiff") and respectfully brings this Complaint for Modification of Custody Order pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §28 and other applicable law. Plaintiff asserts that there are material and substantial changes in circumstances since the entry of the prior custody order issued by this Honorable Court on June 15, 2021, and modification is necessary in the best interests of the minor child, Emily Johnson (the "Child"). Plaintiff seeks to modify the custody and parenting time schedule to address the Child's emotional, physical, and educational well-being, which have been adversely impacted by the Defendant’s plans to move out of state to New Hampshire.

In further support of this Complaint for Modification, Plaintiff states as follows:

---

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

1. **The Parties**  
   a. Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, is the mother of the minor child, Emily Johnson, born on January [Insert Date], 2018. Plaintiff resides at [Insert Address], which remains in close proximity to the Child’s school and extracurricular activities.  
   b. Defendant, Michael Johnson, is the father of the minor child, Emily Johnson, and currently resides at [Insert Current Address]. Defendant has expressed an intent to relocate to New Hampshire for employment purposes.  

2. **The Current Custody Order**  
   a. On June 15, 2021, this Court entered a custody order granting Plaintiff primary physical custody of Emily Johnson, with Defendant having parenting time every Wednesday overnight and every other weekend.  
   b. This custody arrangement was based on the existing circumstance of both parties living in close proximity within the Cambridge area and the Child attending a local school.  

3. **Material Change in Circumstances**  
   a. Since the entry of the current custody order, Defendant has accepted a job offer in New Hampshire and intends to move approximately ninety minutes from Plaintiff’s residence.  
   b. Defendant asserts he will maintain the current parenting schedule, which requires Emily to endure long drives of approximately ninety minutes each way for midweek overnight parenting time.  
   c. These long midweek drives pose significant challenges to Emily’s well-being, including:  
      i. Increased anxiety and emotional distress, as demonstrated by the Child expressing discomfort and resistance to the frequent travel;  
      ii. Disruption to educational routines, including difficulty arriving at school on time and alert after midweek transitions;  
      iii. The Child missing after-school activities and opportunities for socialization due to travel constraints.  

4. **Best Interests of the Child**  
   a. The current parenting arrangement is no longer tenable or in Emily's best interests, as it disregards the Child's physical comfort, emotional stability, and educational needs.  
   b. Plaintiff has proposed modifying the parenting schedule to eliminate the midweek overnight visits and restructure weekend parenting time to accommodate the geographic distance between the parties' residences.

**RELIEF REQUESTED**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Modify the current custody order entered on June 15, 2021, to reflect the material change in circumstances due to Defendant's relocation to New Hampshire;  
2. Issue a new custody and parenting time arrangement eliminating the midweek overnight parenting time and restructuring weekend parenting time to better suit the Child’s best interests given the distance between the parties;  
3. Allocate responsibility for transportation in a manner that minimizes the disruption to Emily’s school, extracurricular activities, and overall well-being;  
4. Award any further relief that this Court deems just and proper.

**LEGAL STANDARD AND AUTHORITY**  

In support of this complaint, Plaintiff relies on the following statutes and case law:

2. *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985), holding that the child's best interests are the paramount consideration in modifying custody orders.  
3. *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012), emphasizing that stability is a key factor in determining the child’s best interests.  
4. *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981), reiterating the importance of protecting a child’s emotional and physical development in custody matters.

6. *Pizzino v. Miller*, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006), recognizing that geographic distance may necessitate adjustments to parenting schedules.  
7. *Haas v. Puchalski*, 9 Mass. L. Rptr. 350 (1998), ruling that long-distance parenting arrangements must consider the child’s practical needs and routine.  
8. *Schechter v. Schechter*, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015), affirming the importance of minimizing conflict and stress for the child in custody determinations.  
9. *Dugan v. Dugan*, 93 Mass. App. Ct. 1118 (2018), addressing the rationale for modifying custody when a parent's relocation significantly disrupts the parenting framework.
