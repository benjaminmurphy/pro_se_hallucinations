**Jessica Ramirez,**  
Plaintiff,  
v.  
**Mark Wilson,**  
Defendant.  
_________________________________________  

**COMPLAINT**  

Plaintiff Jessica Ramirez files this Complaint against Defendant Mark Wilson and states as follows:  

### I. PARTIES  

1. Plaintiff Jessica Ramirez (“Plaintiff”) is an individual who resides at 45 Washington Ave, Apartment [X], Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150.  
2. Defendant Mark Wilson (“Defendant”) is the owner and landlord of the residential property located at 45 Washington Ave, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150, where Plaintiff resides.  

### II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE  

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this case pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, as the claims arise from a residential lease agreement executed and performed in Chelsea, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.  
4. Venue is proper in this Court under G.L. c. 223, § 1 since the property at issue is located in Chelsea, Massachusetts, and the Defendant conducts business there.  

### III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

5. Plaintiff has been a lawful tenant of Defendant since June 1, 2022, under a residential lease agreement. Plaintiff pays $1,500 in monthly rent pursuant to said lease agreement.  
6. The residential property at issue consists of a multi-unit apartment building with a shared main building entrance.  
7. Massachusetts law, including G.L. c. 186, §§ 14 and 15, provides tenants with a covenant of quiet enjoyment, mandating that landlords must not interfere with a tenant’s reasonable use and enjoyment of their residence.  
8. For over two months, Plaintiff has made repeated complaints to Defendant regarding the broken lock on the main front door of the building, which compromises the overall security of the building by allowing unauthorized and potentially dangerous individuals to enter without resistance.  
9. Despite assurances from Defendant that the lock would be repaired, no action has been taken to resolve the issue as of the date of this filing, December 1, 2025.  
10. As a direct result of the broken lock, the following incidents have occurred:  
   a. Unauthorized individuals have gained access to the building, including entering the communal hallway.  
   b. Packages, including one belonging to Plaintiff valued at $120, were stolen from the hallway in November 2025.  
   c. Plaintiff has found evidence, including personal belongings, indicating that an unknown individual has been sleeping in the basement of the building.  
11. These ongoing issues have significantly impacted Plaintiff’s safety, comfort, and ability to use and enjoy her rented premises, causing considerable stress and financial damages.  
12. To mitigate the risks caused by Defendant’s failure to act, Plaintiff has incurred $200 in costs for installing a personal security camera and upgraded deadbolt lock on her own apartment door.  
13. Defendant has dismissed Plaintiff’s concerns as an overreaction and has refused to take measures to ensure the building's security, despite his obligations as a landlord to provide adequate safety measures.  
14. Defendant’s actions, omissions, and refusal to repair the broken lock constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law.  

### IV. CAUSE OF ACTION  
### COUNT I: BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT (G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

15. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  
16. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, every Massachusetts lease includes a covenant of quiet enjoyment by implied law, granting tenants the right to possession, use, and enjoyment of their rental property without substantial interference by the landlord.  
17. Defendant’s failure to repair the broken lock on the main building door, despite repeated notice and requests from Plaintiff, constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of her rental property.  
18. Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment is further evidenced by the following:  
   a. The unauthorized access by third parties to the building due to the broken lock;  
   b. The theft of Plaintiff’s package, valued at $120, from the hallway of the building in November 2025;  
   c. The unauthorized and unknown occupation of the basement of the building;  
   d. Plaintiff’s inability to reasonably and securely enjoy her living environment.  
19. Defendant’s conduct constitutes an ongoing failure to uphold his statutory duties as a landlord under Massachusetts law, including the duty to keep the rental premises in good repair and to ensure the common areas are secure and habitable as required by the State Sanitary Code (105 CMR 410.480).  
20. Massachusetts courts have repeatedly held landlords liable for breaches of the covenant of quiet enjoyment in cases involving similar factual circumstances, including the failure to provide safe and habitable premises. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982); *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997); *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994).  
21. Defendant’s breach has caused Plaintiff to suffer actual damages, including the $120 loss of her stolen package, $200 in expenses for increased security measures, and emotional distress caused by diminished safety and habitability.  
22. Plaintiff is entitled to recover damages as provided by G.L. c. 186, § 14, which allows for the recovery of actual damages or three times the monthly rent for breaches of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, whichever is greater, along with costs and attorneys’ fees.  

### V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:  

1. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14;  
2. Award Plaintiff actual damages of $320, consisting of $120 for the stolen package and $200 for the cost of additional security measures;  
3. Award Plaintiff statutory damages in the amount of three times the monthly rent under G.L. c. 186, § 14, totaling $4,500 ($1,500 × 3);  
4. Award Plaintiff reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14;  
5. Grant such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.  

### VI. JURY DEMAND  

Plaintiff respectfully requests a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,
