      "support_reasoning": "The case concerns standards for modifying custody and permitting removal from the Commonwealth; it does not address parental alcohol use, material changes based on substance abuse, or specific safety concerns like those in the proposed proposition. While the opinion discusses the court\u2019s general authority to modify or restrict custody in the child\u2019s best interests, it is not about imposing restrictions on parenting time due to alcohol consumption or any comparable safety-based change.

The court emphasizes that the \u2018best interests\u2019 principle focuses on the child\u2019s welfare, even when it limits a parent\u2019s liberties, which aligns with the proposition that the child\u2019s safety and well-being are paramount in crafting or modifying custody orders.",
