DOCKET NO.: __________  

**JESSICA THOMPSON,**  
      Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MICHAEL THOMPSON,**  
      Defendant.  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**  

**INTRODUCTION**  
1. This is a complaint to modify the custody arrangement for the minor children, Liam Thompson (age 10) and Emma Thompson (age 8), entered by this Court on June 15, 2022, in accordance with G.L. c. 208, § 28 and related Massachusetts family law.  

2. Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, seeks modification of the order because a material change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the original custody judgment and because such modification is in the best interest of the children.

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
6. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 31, as well as the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), G.L. c. 209B, § 2, because this is the Court that entered the original custody order and Massachusetts is the home state of the minor children.  

7. Venue is proper in the Bristol Probate and Family Court because both parties and the children reside in Bristol County.

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
8. Pursuant to the order of this Court dated June 15, 2022, Plaintiff and Defendant share legal custody over the minor children. The children reside primarily with Plaintiff, with parenting time with Defendant occurring every other weekend.  

9. The original custody order was based on the presumption that both parties would cooperate and communicate in good faith to promote the best interests of the children. The order further required each parent to support the children’s relationships with the other parent and prohibited both parents from disparaging the other in the presence of the children.  

10. Over the past year, Defendant has repeatedly made decisions regarding the children’s extracurricular activities unilaterally, enrolling them in activities during Plaintiff’s custodial time without consulting Plaintiff or obtaining her agreement.  

11. Defendant has told the children that Plaintiff is to blame if they are unable to attend these activities and has stated that Plaintiff “does not love them” and is “selfish” when she asks to maintain her scheduled custodial weekends.  

12. These comments have negatively affected the children’s emotional well-being. Plaintiff’s child, Emma, has developed frequent stomachaches on transition days, which Plaintiff believes are related to anxiety caused by the current arrangement.  

13. The children’s relationship with Plaintiff is being undermined by Defendant’s behavior, which is contrary to both the prior agreement and the children's best interests.  

14. There has been a material change in circumstances since the entry of the June 15, 2022, order that warrants modification of the custody arrangement to provide greater stability and clearer decision-making authority.

**RELIEF REQUESTED**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Modify the current custody order by awarding Plaintiff sole legal custody of the minor children or, in the alternative, awarding Plaintiff exclusive authority over extracurricular and scheduling decisions to avoid further conflict.  

2. Modify the current parenting schedule to reflect that the children shall reside primarily with Plaintiff, with parenting time for Defendant as the Court deems appropriate, consistent with the children’s best interests.  

3. Order both parties to refrain from disparaging language about the other parent in the presence of the children.  

4. Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

**LEGAL CITATIONS**  
In support of the requested modification, Plaintiff relies upon the following legal authorities:  

1. *G.L. c. 208, § 28*—Permits modification of custody orders upon a showing of material and substantial change in circumstances in the best interests of the child.  
2. *G.L. c. 208, § 31*—Defines joint custody and establishes best interests of the child as the standard for custody decisions.  
3. *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985)—Affirms that the child’s welfare is the paramount concern in custody determinations.  
4. *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012)—Reiterates that the best interests of the child standard governs modification requests.  
5. *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981)—States that interfering with the child’s relationship with the other parent can justify modifying custody.  
6. *Schultz v. Kelly*, 32 Mass. App. Ct. 232 (1992)—Recognizes emotional harm to the child as a factor in modifying custody.  
7. *D.F. v. J.F.*, 91 Mass. App. Ct. 184 (2017)—Addresses unilateral decision-making as a basis for changing legal custody arrangements.  
8. *Charara v. Yatim*, 78 Mass. App. Ct. 325 (2010)—Affirms that decisions undermining the child’s relationship with the other parent may warrant a custody modification.  
9. *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540 (2010)—Emphasizes that stability and minimizing conflict are central to a child’s well-being.  
10. *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981)—Confirms that substantial interference with the custodial parent’s rights or time supports a modification request.
