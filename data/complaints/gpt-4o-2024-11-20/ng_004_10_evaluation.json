It does not announce a broad rule that landowners are responsible for addressing unsafe snow and ice conditions on their property or abutting sidewalks; instead, it affirms judgment for the defendant because there was insufficient evidence of notice.

While the case mentions general premises-liability duties and proximate cause, it is focused on duty and control over public highways, not on foreseeability of an icy sidewalk condition. Using this case to support a proposition about foreseeability of hazards from failure to salt or sand an icy sidewalk would be inaccurate and out of context.",
