There is no discussion of G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, implied lease covenants, or any residential tenancy issues. Therefore, it cannot be cited as authority for an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment in residential leases under Massachusetts law.",

We construe the findings of the master as establishing that the brook which ran through the land of the defendants was a natural watercourse.

The court explains that quiet enjoyment encompasses freedom from serious interferences that impair the character and value of the premises, and explicitly concludes that Gem\u2019s failure to maintain sanitary, watertight conditions, allowing repeated flooding to continue, made it liable for interfering with Solomon\u2019s quiet enjoyment. This directly supports the proposition that a landlord\u2019s ongoing refusal to remedy water intrusion can amount to a continuing breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe common law background of \u00a7 14 also suggests that malicious intent is not a condition of liability. The phrase \u2018quiet enjoyment\u2019 is a familiar term in landlord-tenant law, signifying the tenant\u2019s right to freedom from serious interferences with his tenancy \u2014 acts or omissions that \u2018impair the character and value of the leased premises.\u2019 \u2026 Finally, Gem is liable to Solomon under \u00a7 14 because it violated its underlying duty to maintain sanitary conditions in her apartment, and thereby permitted repeated flooding to occur that interfered with her quiet enjoyment of her apartment.\u201d"

The court emphasizes that the landlord\u2019s conduct (including inaction and failure to abate a known, ongoing problem) is sufficient, even without an intent to evict, and treats the resulting substantial deprivation as a constructive eviction. By analogy, a landlord\u2019s refusal to remedy serious water intrusion that substantially interferes with peaceful enjoyment would fall within this principle.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "There are occasions, however, where a landlord has not intended to violate a tenant\u2019s rights, but there was nevertheless a breach of the landlord\u2019s covenant of quiet enjoyment which flowed as the natural and probable consequence of what the landlord did, what he failed to do, or what he permitted to be done... Although some of our opinions have spoken of particular action or inaction by a landlord as showing a presumed intention to evict, the landlord\u2019s conduct, and not his intentions, is controlling."

Massachusetts cases generally recognize that this statutory covenant is read into residential tenancies. By relying on \u00a7 14 as the source of tenants\u2019 quiet enjoyment rights in this context, the case provides supportive (though not explicit) authority for the proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "General Laws c. 186, \u00a7 14, provides, in relevant part, that \u201cany lessor or landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant\u201d shall be punished by a fine or imprisonment, and also shall be subject to liability to the tenant for damages arising from the interference. This section also confers on the Superior and District Courts the authority in equity to restrain violations of its provisions.

It concerns contract-based claims and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the context of interior design services and alleged misuse of a restaurant concept.

The court affirms a damages award based on property damage and lost business income arising directly from the landlord\u2019s acts that made access difficult, created noise, dirt, dust, dampness, and interruptions of utilities, thereby substantially impairing the tenant\u2019s beneficial enjoyment.
