v.  
**Thomas Reed,**  
**Defendant.**

Civil Action No. ____________

**COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**

**INTRODUCTION**  
1. This is a civil action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, a statutory and common law right guaranteed to tenants in Massachusetts. The Plaintiff, Jessica Li, brings this action against her landlord, Thomas Reed, for failure to address unsafe and defective conditions in her rented apartment, rendering one bedroom uninhabitable and substantially interfering with her use and enjoyment of the rental property.

**PARTIES**  
2. Jessica Li ("Plaintiff") resides at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts, which she has rented from the Defendant since January 15, 2022.  
3. Thomas Reed ("Defendant") is the landlord of 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts, and owns and is legally responsible for the maintenance of the property.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
4. This Court has jurisdiction because the rental property is located in Springfield, Massachusetts, and the Defendant conducts business and resides in Massachusetts.  
5. Venue is proper because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Springfield, Massachusetts, within the jurisdiction of the Springfield District Court.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
6. Plaintiff rents a two-bedroom apartment located at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts (the "Apartment") from Defendant.  
7. Plaintiff pays $1,200 in monthly rent to Defendant, pursuant to a tenancy-at-will agreement.  
8. Beginning on or around October 15, 2025, the electrical wiring in one of the Apartment's bedrooms failed, resulting in the complete loss of power to that room, including all electrical outlets and the overhead light.  
9. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the condition, and Defendant sent an electrician to assess the issue. The electrician determined that the repair would require additional work to resolve due to the building's old wiring.  
10. Since that initial assessment, Defendant has failed to make any repairs, claiming that the work is "complicated" and that he is obtaining quotes. However, more than six weeks have elapsed without any further action or meaningful timeline for repairs from Defendant.  
11. As a result of the defective electrical wiring, Plaintiff has been unable to use the bedroom as a home office, forcing her to work in overcrowded spaces in the living room or at coffee shops, where she incurs additional daily expenses of approximately $15. Plaintiff has also been forced to pay for a coworking space membership at a cost of $150 per month.  
12. The unusable bedroom has caused Plaintiff significant inconvenience and interference with her enjoyment of her home, including reducing available living space, disrupting her professional activities, and lowering the overall habitability of the Apartment.  
13. Despite repeated notifications from Plaintiff, Defendant continues to delay necessary repairs, causing ongoing harm to Plaintiff.  
14. Defendant's conduct constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts General Laws ch. 186, § 14.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  

**COUNT I: Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  
15. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  
16. Massachusetts General Laws ch. 186, § 14 establishes that a landlord may not interfere with a tenant's quiet enjoyment of their rental property and provides for damages and attorney’s fees for violations.  
17. The covenant of quiet enjoyment has been interpreted as ensuring that tenants have a right to undisturbed use and enjoyment of their rented premises. *Dartmouth v. Greater N.Y. Corp.*, 352 Mass. 139, 141 (1967).  
18. Defendant violated Plaintiff's right to quiet enjoyment by failing to repair the defective electrical wiring in a timely manner, depriving Plaintiff of the full use of the premises. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 95-97 (1982).  
19. A landlord’s failure to address unsafe or defective conditions that substantially interfere with a tenant’s use of the property constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847, 850-51 (1997).  
20. The inability to access and use one bedroom for more than six weeks has substantially and unreasonably interfered with Plaintiff’s use of the property, rendering Defendant liable for damages. See *Doe v. New Bedford Housing Authority*, 417 Mass. 273, 284 (1994).  
21. Defendant's failure to repair the electrical wiring is a willful and unreasonable failure to act, entitling Plaintiff to damages under Massachusetts General Laws ch. 186, § 14. See *Sheehan v. Weaver*, 467 Mass. 734, 740-41 (2014).  
22. Defendant’s conduct has proximately caused Plaintiff financial harm and significant emotional distress. See *Blackett v. Olanoff*, 371 Mass. 714, 716-17 (1977).  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:  
A. An award of damages to Plaintiff in the amount of $450 for the additional expenses and inconvenience directly caused by Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;  
B. Treble damages pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws ch. 186, § 14;  
C. Reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws ch. 186, § 14;  
D. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

Respectfully submitted,  
Dated: December 1, 2025
