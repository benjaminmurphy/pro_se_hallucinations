Plaintiff,  

v.  

**Alex Chen**,  
Defendant.  
____________________________________  

**CIVIL ACTION NO.: [To be Assigned by the Clerk]**

**COMPLAINT**    

**PARTIES**  

1. The Plaintiff, *Jordan Miller* ("Plaintiff"), is an individual residing in Boston, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  
2. The Defendant, *Alex Chen* ("Defendant"), is an individual residing in Boston, Massachusetts.

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, which grants jurisdiction to the Superior Court for civil actions where the controversy exceeds $25,000.  
4. Venue is proper in Suffolk County pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1 because the incident giving rise to this action occurred in Boston, Massachusetts, which is located in Suffolk County.

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

5. On July 15, 2023, at approximately 8:30 a.m., Plaintiff was riding their bicycle in a marked bike lane on Park Drive in Boston, Massachusetts.  
6. Plaintiff was wearing a helmet and exercising due care while operating their bicycle in compliance with all applicable traffic laws.  
7. At or near 200 Park Drive, Defendant, a rideshare driver, was parked in a designated loading zone adjacent to the bike lane.  
8. Defendant, without checking for approaching bicyclists, carelessly opened the driver's side door of their vehicle directly into the bike lane.  
9. As a result of Defendant’s sudden and unexpected action, Plaintiff collided with Defendant's car door and was ejected from their bicycle, landing forcefully on the pavement.  
10. At the scene, Defendant admitted to failing to see Plaintiff before opening the car door because he was "checking his phone."  
11. As a direct and proximate result of the collision, Plaintiff suffered physical injuries, including road rash to their arms and legs, a chipped front tooth, and damage to their bicycle.  
12. Plaintiff incurred medical expenses for dental work in the amount of $1,200.  
13. Plaintiff also suffered property damage, including a bent bicycle frame, requiring the purchase of a new bicycle at a cost of $1,800.  
14. Plaintiff additionally lost approximately $600 in wages due to missed work while recovering from their injuries.  
15. Defendant later provided false information to his insurance company, claiming Plaintiff had been "weaving in and out of traffic," a statement that is wholly untrue.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION: NEGLIGENCE**  

16. Plaintiff incorporates all prior paragraphs as if fully restated herein.  
17. Under Massachusetts law, Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the operation of their vehicle and in the opening of vehicle doors adjacent to marked bike lanes. See G.L. c. 90, § 14 (“No person shall open a door of a motor vehicle unless it is reasonably safe to do so and can be done without interfering with the movement of other traffic.”).  
18. Defendant breached this duty of care by opening their vehicle door into Plaintiff’s path without first ensuring it was safe to do so, in violation of G.L. c. 90, § 14.  
19. Defendant’s actions constitute negligence under well-established Massachusetts law. See *Powers v. Freetown-Highway Dept.*, 23 Mass. App. Ct. 700, 703 (1987) (negligence consists of failing to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances).  
20. Defendant’s act of looking at their phone rather than checking for bicyclists or other traffic demonstrates additional negligence. See *Beaudette v. Department of Conservation & Recreation*, 94 Mass. App. Ct. 374, 377 (2018) (an operator is negligent where they fail to keep a proper lookout).  
21. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff sustained physical injuries, property damage, loss of wages, and emotional distress.  
22. Plaintiff’s injuries and damages were reasonably foreseeable consequences of Defendant’s negligent act of opening a vehicle door without adequately checking their surroundings.  

**DAMAGES**  

23. Plaintiff’s damages include, but are not limited to:  
   a. Medical expenses totaling $1,200;  
   b. Property damage to Plaintiff’s bicycle in the amount of $1,800;  
   c. Lost wages totaling $600; and  
   d. Compensation for pain and suffering, mental anguish, and emotional distress caused by the incident.  
24. Plaintiff seeks all damages recoverable under Massachusetts law, including compensatory damages for economic and non-economic losses.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jordan Miller respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in their favor and against Defendant Alex Chen, and award the following relief:  

A. Compensatory damages in an amount to be established at trial, but not less than $25,000, to compensate Plaintiff for medical expenses, property damage, lost wages, and pain and suffering;  
B. Interest, costs, and attorneys' fees as allowed by law; and  
C. Such further and additional relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

**DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL**  

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,  

Dated: December 1, 2025
