**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**CHELSEA DISTRICT COURT**  

**Jessica Harris,**  
**Plaintiff,**  
v.  
**Mark Thompson,**  
**Defendant.**  

CIVIL ACTION NO.: ____________________  

**COMPLAINT**  

**INTRODUCTION**  
This is a civil action brought by Plaintiff Jessica Harris against her landlord, Defendant Mark Thompson, for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts General Laws. Defendant's failures to maintain the premises and address grave security issues have deprived Plaintiff of her right to use and enjoy her dwelling in peace. Plaintiff seeks damages caused by Defendant's statutory violations and failure to perform his obligations as a landlord.  

**PARTIES**  
1. Plaintiff Jessica Harris resides at 15 Mystic Street, Apartment #___, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150. Plaintiff has rented the property from Defendant pursuant to a lease agreement since May 1, 2022.  
2. Defendant Mark Thompson is the owner and landlord of the premises located at 15 Mystic Street, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150. Defendant conducts business at the same address and is responsible for maintaining the property and ensuring tenant safety.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws c. 231, §1.  
4. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws c. 223, §2, as the events giving rise to this action occurred in Chelsea, Massachusetts, and the property at issue is located within this Court’s jurisdiction.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
5. Plaintiff has leased a residential apartment at 15 Mystic Street in Chelsea, Massachusetts, from Defendant since May 1, 2022, for a monthly rent of $1,500.  
6. In or around October 2025, Plaintiff discovered that the main entry door to the building did not properly lock. The door fails to latch, allowing anyone to enter the building without a key.  
7. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant about the defective lock and requested repairs. Defendant acknowledged the issue and stated he would fix it.  
8. Despite repeated reminders by Plaintiff, including at least two follow-ups, Defendant has failed to repair the lock as of the date of this Complaint.  
9. In November 2025, an unauthorized individual entered the building and rifled through residents’ mail, resulting in multiple thefts. Plaintiff had a package containing goods worth approximately $120 stolen during this incident.  
10. Plaintiff has also observed evidence that an unknown person has been sleeping in the building’s basement, further alarming her and other tenants.  
11. In response to the ongoing security issues, Plaintiff spent approximately $200 to purchase a security camera for her apartment door and to upgrade her personal deadbolt. These expenses were necessary to ensure her personal safety, which Defendant has failed to provide.  
12. When confronted again about these issues, Defendant downplayed Plaintiff’s concerns and dismissed her complaints by stating that she was “overreacting.”  
13. Defendant’s failure to repair the entry door and maintain the premises in a secure condition has created a serious interference with Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy her apartment.  
14. Defendant’s actions and inactions as described herein constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment owed to Plaintiff pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, §14.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  

**COUNT I – Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (Mass. Gen. Laws c. 186, §14)**  
15. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1–14 of this Complaint.  
16. Under Massachusetts law, every residential lease contains an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, as codified in Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, §14, which prohibits a landlord from interfering substantially with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of their rental property.  
17. Defendant, by failing to repair the defective lock on the main entry to the building, has unreasonably failed to take necessary measures to secure the building and ensure Plaintiff’s safety.  
18. Defendant’s failure to address this security issue has led directly to thefts and unauthorized access within the building, preventing Plaintiff from enjoying her living space in peace.  
19. Defendant’s dismissal of Plaintiff’s repeated complaints and his refusal to make necessary repairs constitute substantial and intentional interferences with Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment.  
20. Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment violates Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, §14 and entitles Plaintiff to damages and additional relief.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  
a. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, §14;  
b. Award Plaintiff damages in the amount of $320, including $120 for the stolen package and $200 for her out-of-pocket expenses to secure her apartment door, an amount trebled as required by Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, §14;  
c. Award Plaintiff her reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, as provided for under Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, §14; and  
d. Grant such other relief as may be just and proper.  

**JURY DEMAND**  
Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,  

Dated: December 1, 2025
