      "support_reasoning": "The case concerns a municipality\u2019s potential liability, as a public landowner, for failing to fence or post warnings on city property near a railroad shortcut. In discussing duty, the court notes that a landowner\u2019s duty of reasonable care may sometimes extend beyond its property lines, but it does not involve a homeowner, public sidewalks, or a duty to persons lawfully using adjacent public sidewalks. The opinion ultimately finds the off-premises danger too remote and exempts the city from liability under public-duty and discretionary-function principles, so it does not support the specific sidewalk\u2011adjacent duty proposition claimed.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cWe agree with the plaintiffs that in some situations a landowner\u2019s duty to exercise reasonable care does not terminate abruptly at the borders of his property but may extend to include a duty to take safety measures related to known dangers on adjacent property. See Polak v. Whitney, 21 Mass. App. Ct. 349, 351-352 (1985), and cases cited. Given the obviousness of the danger here, however, we doubt that a private landowner in the position of the city would be liable to one in the position of either of the plaintiffs\u2019 decedents.\u201d"

It does not discuss premises liability, dangerous conditions on property, visibility of defects, or knowledge imputed to a defendant based on neighbor complaints about a cracked tree branch. Therefore, it does not provide authority for the stated proposition about a defendant\u2019s knowledge of a dangerous property condition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "The defendant was indicted by a Norfolk County grand jury on a charge of murder in the second degree. The victim was a sixteen-month-old baby boy. At trial, doctors testified that the baby had died of an acute bilateral subdural hematoma as a result of blunt force trauma to the head. It was the Commonwealth\u2019s theory that, while alone with the victim, the defendant became angry and struck the baby on the head, causing his death. The defendant contended, however, that the baby had received his fatal injury as a result of an unfortunate accident."

The court upholds the jury\u2019s finding that Edison negligently designed and maintained the pole by failing to account for foreseeable vehicular impacts in a busy shopping area, thereby creating an unreasonable and foreseeable risk of injury to people lawfully using the streets and sidewalks. This aligns with the proposition that defendant\u2019s failure to act reasonably under the circumstances created a foreseeable risk of harm to sidewalk users, including the plaintiffs.",
