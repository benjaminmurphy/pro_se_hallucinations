However, the discussed liability is not framed around a failure to act after being notified of hazardous conditions, nor does it focus on health-related consequential damages (like illness) as opposed to direct physical injury from a structural defect. General Laws c. 186, \u00a7 19 (the notice-based statute) is quoted in a footnote, but the holding does not turn on notice or consequential health harms, so the case does not squarely support the specific proposition stated.",

While the opinion focuses on liability rather than quantifying \"actual\" versus \"punitive\" damages, \u00a7 14 itself provides for multiple damages (which Massachusetts decisions describe as punitive in nature) and the court here reaffirms that tenants may obtain damages and attorneys\u2019 fees under this statute.

This section also confers on the Superior and District Courts the authority in equity to restrain violations of its provisions. \u2026 If the defendant has taken no action or inadequate action, despite covenanting that the plaintiffs\u2019 right to quiet enjoyment shall not be interfered with, then the plaintiffs will be entitled to judgment, appropriate injunctive relief, costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.
