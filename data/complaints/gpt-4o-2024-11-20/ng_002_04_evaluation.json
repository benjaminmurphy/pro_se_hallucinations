With respect to each such claim, the plaintiffs bear the burden of proving that the defendant committed a breach of the duty to use reasonable care, that the plaintiffs suffered actual loss, and that the defendant\u2019s negligence caused their loss. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 281 (1965); J.R. Nolan & L.J. Sartorio, Tort Law \u00a7 204 (2d ed. 1989). Causation is an essential element of that proof.\u201d"

While the opinion discusses foreseeability of harm to the motoring public from drunk driving, there is no discussion of animals, parks, or dog control, so it cannot be cited as authority for a proposition about a defendant\u2019s failure to control his dog in a park.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"We conclude that there is a special relationship between a police officer who negligently fails to remove an intoxicated motorist from the highway, and a member of the public who suffers injury as a result of that failure. The statutes which establish police responsibilities in such circumstances evidence a legislative intent to protect both intoxicated persons and other users of the highway. As to the most crucial factor \u2014 foreseeability \u2014 the calamitous consequences to the victims of accidents caused by drunken driving are all too predictable.\""

It does not involve proximate cause in the context of a plaintiff swerving off a path to avoid a perceived charging dog, nor any analogous fact pattern about animals or evasive maneuvers. Therefore, it does not provide authority for the specific causation proposition stated.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cWe continue to adhere to the rule expressed in Langemann, and we think that that rule should apply here. It should make no difference that the plaintiffs, instead of being automobile accident victims, are victims of assault and battery, nor should it make a difference that the parent is at home when and where the party takes place, instead of being away.\u2026 In our view, sound social policy would not be advanced by a rule that would place a parent who absents himself or herself during a \u2018young person\u2019s\u2019 party in a better position than a parent who remains on the scene to supervise the party.\u201d"

It concerns landowners\u2019 duties to lawful visitors and abolishes the natural/unnatural snow and ice distinction; it does not involve dogs, leash requirements, parks, or foreseeability of injuries caused by animals.
