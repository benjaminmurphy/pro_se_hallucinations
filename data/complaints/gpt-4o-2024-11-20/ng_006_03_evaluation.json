The resulting flames flashed back to the source of the fumes in the engine compartment and then burned with high intensity through the vent she had opened."

The concurring justice explicitly agrees that the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were not within the reasonably foreseeable risk created by the defendant\u2019s negligence, which undercuts rather than supports a straightforward assertion that, but for the defendant\u2019s negligence, the injuries would not have occurred. The opinion thus does not affirm the proposition as stated and instead focuses on limiting liability based on foreseeability, not establishing but-for causation in plaintiff\u2019s favor.",

It does not address negligence, causation, or foreseeability relating to opening a car door or causing physical injuries. Therefore, it provides no authority for the proposition that a defendant\u2019s act of opening a car door without checking for safety was the direct and proximate cause of a plaintiff\u2019s injuries.",

App. Ct. 194 (1989), we decided that, under the standard automobile insurance policy approved by the Commissioner of Insurance for use in 1981, a party injured in an automobile accident had the right to arbitration of his claim against his insurance company for underinsurance benefits before all claims he might have had against any alleged tortfeasors were settled or judicially resolved. On the basis of intervening changes in the wording of the standard automobile policy and in the governing statutes, we are asked in this appeal to rule that the Faris interpretation does not apply to the later policies. We decline so to rule.\""

It does not address or recognize damages for lost wages or property damage, and while it mentions physical injuries and medical treatment, its holding is limited to emotional distress damages.
