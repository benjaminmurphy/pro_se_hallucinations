**LAURA JOHNSON,**  
*Plaintiff,*  
  
v.  

**MARK THOMPSON,**  
*Defendant.*  

**_________________________________________**  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

**NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Laura Johnson, and respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the existing custody and parenting time order entered on March 15, 2021. As grounds for this Complaint, Plaintiff states the following:**  

---

**1. PARTIES**  

1. Plaintiff, Laura Johnson, resides at [Insert Full Address], and is the mother and custodial parent of the minor children, Emma Thompson, age 8, and Liam Thompson, age 6.  
2. Defendant, Mark Thompson, resides at [Insert Full Address] and is the father of the minor children.  

---

**2. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

3. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 209C, § 20, as both Plaintiff and Defendant reside in Massachusetts and this action concerns the custody and parenting of minor children habitually residing in the Commonwealth.  
4. Venue is proper in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 8, as both parties reside in Bristol County.  

---

**3. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

5. On March 15, 2021, this Honorable Court entered a custody and parenting time order granting the Plaintiff primary physical custody of the minor children. The Defendant was awarded parenting time every other weekend and one overnight visit during the week.  
6. At the time the order was entered, both parties were employed in traditional daytime jobs with regular hours. The parenting plan reflected the practical and logistical needs of both parties and the best interests of the children at that time.  
7. In 2025, the Defendant began employment in a position requiring him to work overnight shifts from 7:00 PM to 7:00 AM several nights each week, including nights during which he is scheduled to exercise overnight parenting time.  
8. Due to his overnight work schedule, the Defendant has routinely been unable to meet the parenting time obligations set forth in the original order. The Defendant now frequently:  
   a. Drops the minor children off at Plaintiff’s residence during or before his scheduled parenting time with little to no advance notice, citing fatigue after his work shifts; and  
   b. Leaves the children in the care of his roommate, an individual who is not well-known to Plaintiff and with whom Plaintiff has serious concerns about the children’s safety and supervision.  
9. The children have further reported to Plaintiff that, on occasions when Defendant does exercise his parenting time, they have spent the night unsupervised or sleeping on the couch while Defendant naps immediately following his overnight work shifts.  
10. Defendant’s repeated inability to provide proper supervision and care during his scheduled parenting time constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances since the original custody order was issued.  
11. The current parenting plan no longer serves the best interests of the minor children, as it jeopardizes their safety, stability, and routine, contrary to the principles established in *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012).  

---

**4. APPLICABLE LAW**  

12. A complaint for modification may be granted upon a showing of a "material and substantial change in circumstances" that affects the best interests of the children. G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Schechter v. Schechter*, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015).  
13. The best interests of the child are paramount in all custody decisions. See *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 710 (1985).  
14. Parental unavailability or inability to meet scheduled parenting commitments may constitute a material change in circumstances. See *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).  
15. A parent leaving children unsupervised or with third parties not approved by the custodial parent raises legitimate concerns regarding the children’s welfare. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).  
16. Courts have found that modifications should account for changes in a parent’s work schedule where the changes interfere with the original parenting arrangement. See *Murray v. Super*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015).  
17. The Plaintiff’s request is consistent with the Massachusetts principle that stability in the parenting plan and home environment is critical to the welfare of the children. See *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).  
18. The facts here also align with rulings in *Bak v. Bak*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 608 (1987), and *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981), which emphasize the importance of parental availability during parenting time.

**5. REQUESTED RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the original custody and parenting time order on March 15, 2021;  
2. Modify the existing custody and parenting time order to ensure that the Defendant’s parenting time occurs only on days or nights when he is not scheduled to work overnight shifts, and that all overnight visits are contingent upon the Defendant’s ability to provide direct supervision and care;  
3. Order that any third parties responsible for supervising the minor children during the Defendant’s parenting time must be approved in advance by the Plaintiff;  
4. Award such other and further relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,  
DATED: December 1, 2025
