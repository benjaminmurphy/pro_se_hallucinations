The case provides general authority that substantial interference with use and enjoyment violates quiet enjoyment, but it does not address electrical failures or habitability-type physical defects as constituting such interference. Thus, it is only indirectly relevant and does not specifically support the proposition about electrical failure.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe covenant of quiet enjoyment protects a tenant\u2019s right to freedom from serious interference with his tenancy \u2014 acts or omissions that impair the character and value of the leasehold. \u2026 In this case, we have no doubt that, if the plaintiffs truly are unable to use the common areas of the development, including sidewalks, streets, parking lots, and recreation areas within it, then the situation constitutes a serious interference with their quiet enjoyment and substantially impairs the character of the leased premises.\u201d"
