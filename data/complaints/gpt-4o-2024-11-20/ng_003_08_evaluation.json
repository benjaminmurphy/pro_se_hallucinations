It does not state or discuss a specific duty of care owed to invitees or customers, nor does it address maintaining premises in a reasonably safe condition or implementing safety measures. While the main Mounsey opinion is well-known for expanding occupiers\u2019 duties, this particular quoted passage does not itself support the detailed proposition given.",

But footnote 7 seems to say that 'trespassers' stand apart, that that characterization is to remain decisive or highly influential.\""

      "support_confidence": "high",
      "support_reasoning": "The opinion does not find that the defendant had constructive or actual knowledge of a specific hazardous stacking practice in its store. Instead, the court adopts the mode-of-operation doctrine and holds that the defendant had notice of the inherent risks associated with its self-service operation generally, which satisfies the notice element without proof of actual or constructive knowledge of the particular grape or display. The proposition mischaracterizes the holding as a traditional constructive-knowledge finding about stacking practices, which this case expressly moves away from.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cIn sum, the adoption of the mode of operation approach will not modify the general rule governing premises liability requiring a plaintiff to prove that an owner had either actual or constructive notice of an unsafe condition on the premises. However, if a plaintiff proves that an unsafe condition on an owner\u2019s premises exists that was reasonably foreseeable, resulting from an owner\u2019s self-service business or mode of operation, and the plaintiff slips as a result of the unsafe condition, the plaintiff will satisfy the notice requirement.\u201d"

      "support_reasoning": "This opinion concerns premises liability for slip-and-fall injuries on snow and ice in a parking lot, and whether to abolish the natural/unnatural accumulation distinction. It does not address falling or improperly stacked merchandise, nor does it discuss foreseeability of merchandise falling on customers. Using this case to support a proposition about foreseeability of injuries from falling merchandise is therefore inaccurate and out of context.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cWe now will apply to hazards arising from snow and ice the same obligation that a property owner owes to lawful visitors as to all other hazards: a duty to \u2018act as a reasonable person under all of the circumstances including the likelihood of injury to others, the probable seriousness of such injuries, and the burden of reducing or avoiding the risk.\u2019\u201d"
