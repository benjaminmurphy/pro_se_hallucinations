He explicitly acknowledges that the majority reverses the old common-law rule of no implied fitness and makes the landlord\u2019s obligation to maintain habitable premises and the tenant\u2019s rent obligation mutually interdependent. Although this passage does not itself elaborate the covenant of quiet enjoyment, the case as a whole is correctly cited for enunciating tenants\u2019 rights under the warranty of habitability and related doctrines.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe opinion of the court holds that the tenants are subject to eviction because of their failure to pay rent, but that their liability for unpaid rent is limited to the reasonable value, if any, of their apartments, considering the alleged violations of the Code. That holding is sufficient to dispose of the only issues raised in these cases, and to that extent I concur with the opinion.\n\u2026\nThe second step required for the removal of the roadblock is the reversal of the present common law rule that the obligation of the tenant to pay rent and the obligation, if any, of the landlord to repair or maintain the rented premises are independent, and the substitution therefor of a new rule that such obligations are substantially mutually interdependent. The opinion of the court accomplishes this.\u201d} RTWF```json```**Note**: This excerpt is from Justice Quirico\u2019s opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part. The majority opinion (not reproduced here) more directly articulates the implied warranty of habitability and its relationship to tenant rights and rent obligations.

It does not separately analyze or highlight a distinct category of \"statutory remedies\" for breach of quiet enjoyment, nor does it specifically frame the holding as clarifying that such remedies \"include damages.\" While \u00a7 14 by its terms provides for damages, this decision is not used here as a clear authority for that particular remedial proposition.",

Although the court ultimately vacates the separate $10,000 quiet-enjoyment damages as duplicative, it squarely states that emotional distress damages are within the scope of consequential damages under \u00a7 14 and uses that conclusion to uphold a substantial attorneys\u2019 fee award tied to the quiet enjoyment claim.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cSection 14 provides that tenants may recover \u2018actual and consequential\u2019 damages from landlords who have interfered with their quiet enjoyment of leased premises. \u2026 Generally, \u2018actual damages\u2019 are losses flowing directly from a wrongful act. \u2026 \u2018Consequential damages\u2019 cover all losses that are reasonably foreseeable to the actor\u2026 For example, consequential damages in an action based on contract or warranty may include personal injuries caused by the breach. \u2026 The combination in \u00a7 14 of both actual and consequential damages, therefore, suggests that the Legislature intended to include all reasonably foreseeable losses \u2014 personal as well as economic \u2014 within the scope of statutory recovery.\u201d"

      "support_reasoning": "The opinion does not address, much less decide, that treble damages are mandated for intentional or reckless landlord interference. Its discussion of treble damages appears only in describing the separate lead paint statute (G.L. c. 111, \u00a7 199), not as an interpretation of G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 14. The holding of Al\u2011Ziab concerns the fault level (at least negligence) required for quiet enjoyment liability and the non\u2011availability of attorney\u2019s fees via \u00a7 14 for mere strict liability lead paint violations, not a mandate of treble damages for intentional or reckless interference under \u00a7 14.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cGeneral Laws c. 111, \u00a7\u00a7 190-199\u2026imposes strict liability on landlords for damages caused by poisoning from lead paint, and provides for treble damages if a landlord has been notified of the presence of lead paint and fails to correct it as provided by the statute. G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 199. \u2026 Significantly, the statute makes no provision for the payment of attorney\u2019s fees\u2026 Were we to accept the plaintiffs\u2019 argument, all landlords held strictly liable under the lead paint statute would necessarily be required to pay the attorney\u2019s fees of the tenant. That result is inconsistent with the statutory scheme\u2026.\u201d"

The court explains that a breach can occur where the disturbing condition is the natural and probable consequence of what the landlord did or failed to do, even though the landlord did not intend to violate the tenant\u2019s rights. This directly supports the proposition that a breach of quiet enjoyment does not require malicious or intentional conduct.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cOur opinions concerning a constructive eviction by an alleged breach of an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment sometimes have stated that the landlord must perform some act with the intent of depriving the tenant of the enjoyment and occupation of the whole or part of the leased premises\u2026 There are occasions, however, where a landlord has not intended to violate a tenant\u2019s rights, but there was nevertheless a breach of the landlord\u2019s covenant of quiet enjoyment\u2026 Although some of our opinions have spoken of\u2026 a presumed intention to evict, the landlord\u2019s conduct, and not his intentions, is controlling.\u201d"
