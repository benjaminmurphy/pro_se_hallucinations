A store owner has been required to maintain its property \u2018in a reasonably safe condition in view of all the circumstances, including the likelihood of injury to others, the seriousness of the injury, and the burden of avoiding the risk.\u2019 Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 708 (1973). \u2026 This court has thus held that premises liability attaches only if a store owner has actual or constructive notice of the existence of the dangerous condition, sufficient to allow time for the owner to remedy the condition.\u201d"

The court emphasizes that the defendants intentionally created and maintained a trampoline-pool setup knowing it was dangerous and that users would likely attempt exactly the kind of conduct that caused plaintiff\u2019s injuries, and it reiterates that precise manner of injury need not be foreseen so long as some such injury is foreseeable. This aligns with the claimed proposition that a defendant\u2019s negligence can cause a plaintiff\u2019s foreseeable injuries under longstanding Massachusetts tort law.",
