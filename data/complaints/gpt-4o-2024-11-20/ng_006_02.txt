### FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

7. On September 15, 2023, Plaintiff Alex Rivera was riding his bicycle to work along 1234 Commonwealth Avenue in Boston, Massachusetts.  

8. Plaintiff was traveling lawfully in a marked bicycle lane, wearing a helmet, and abiding by all traffic rules and regulations.  

9. Defendant Jordan Smith was parked in a designated loading zone adjacent to the bicycle lane to drop off passengers or conduct other business.  

10. Without properly checking his surroundings, including failing to look in his side mirror, Defendant suddenly opened his driver's side vehicle door directly into the bicycle lane.  

11. Plaintiff, who was lawfully riding his bicycle, had no opportunity to avoid the door or Defendant’s actions and collided with the edge of the door.  

12. As a result of the collision, Plaintiff was thrown off his bicycle and onto the pavement, suffering physical injuries and property damage.  

13. At the scene of the incident, Defendant admitted fault, stating, “I didn’t see you because I was looking at my phone.”  

14. Despite this admission, Defendant later provided false information to his insurance company, claiming Plaintiff was weaving in and out of traffic, a baseless assertion wholly contradicted by the circumstances and Plaintiff's testimony.  

15. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligent acts, Plaintiff sustained the following injuries and losses:  
   - Road rash on his arms and legs, causing pain, discomfort, and required medical care.  
   - A chipped front tooth that required dental treatment and restoration.  
   - Damage to his bicycle frame, which necessitated replacement.  
   - Emotional distress and inconvenience.  

16. Plaintiff incurred medical bills totaling approximately $2,500, lost $800 in wages due to missed work, and endured additional damages related to the replacement of his bicycle and other incidental costs.

### COUNT I: NEGLIGENCE  

17. Plaintiff restates and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1-16 as if fully set forth herein.  

18. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in the operation of his vehicle, including the act of opening his door in a lawful, safe, and non-negligent manner.  

19. Defendant breached this duty by:  
   a. Failing to check his surroundings and look in his mirror before opening his door;  
   b. Opening his door into a marked bicycle lane in violation of G.L. c. 90, § 14;  
   c. Failing to act as a reasonably prudent person would under the circumstances; and  
   d. Acting with disregard for the safety of bicyclists and other road users.  

20. Defendant's negligence was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff's injuries and damages.  

21. Defendant’s actions also violated G.L. c. 90, § 14, which requires drivers to avoid opening doors into moving traffic until it is safe to do so. Violations of this statute constitute evidence of negligence. See *Adamian v. Three Sons, Inc.*, 353 Mass. 498, 499–500 (1968).  

22. Massachusetts courts recognize that the violation of traffic safety statutes, including those aimed at protecting bicyclists, constitutes evidence of negligence. See *Lev v. Beverly Enterprises-Massachusetts, Inc.*, 457 Mass. 234, 238 (2010).  

23. Defendant’s failure to exercise due care was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff’s injuries and resultant damages. See *Purtell v. Washing Machine Co.*, 44 Mass. App. Ct. 901 (1997).  

24. Plaintiff further relies on General Laws, Chapter 231, § 85 to establish that Defendant’s negligence renders him fully liable for Plaintiff’s injuries. See *Boyd v. National R.R. Passenger Corp.*, 446 Mass. 540 (2006).
