### **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

6. On or about **November 20, 2022**, Plaintiff viewed the rental unit located at **123 Maple Street, Apartment 1** and expressed concerns about visible water stains on the ceiling.  

7. Plaintiff specifically asked Defendant about the water stains, and Defendant assured Plaintiff that they were from a previous leak that had been "totally fixed."  

8. Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant and began occupying the unit as of **December 1, 2022**, paying monthly rent in the amount of **$1,200**.  

9. Shortly after moving in, during the first significant rainstorm, Plaintiff noticed water dripping from the same area of the ceiling where the water stains were visible.  

10. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant about the water intrusion.  

11. Defendant dismissed Plaintiff’s complaints, characterizing the issue as a "minor cosmetic issue" and asserting that Plaintiff had rented an apartment with "character."  

12. Over the next several months, multiple rainstorms caused further water intrusion. In one instance, water dripping from the ceiling soaked Plaintiff’s couch and damaged her laptop computer, which cost **$900** to replace.

13. Plaintiff repeatedly requested that Defendant repair the leak, but Defendant failed and refused to take any corrective action.  

14. The repeated water infiltration has caused a musty odor to develop in the apartment, leading to concerns about mold growth.  

15. As a result of the water intrusion and the deteriorating conditions in the apartment, Plaintiff has been forced to rearrange her living space, rendering half of the apartment effectively unusable.

16. Plaintiff has also experienced recurring headaches, which she believes may be caused by the mold or overall condition of the apartment.

17. Defendant’s failure to address the water intrusion and resulting conditions constitutes a violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, as codified in **Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14**.

### **CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14)**  

18. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 17, as though fully set forth herein.  

19. Under Massachusetts law, every tenant is entitled to the covenant of quiet enjoyment, which guarantees freedom from serious interference with the use and enjoyment of their rental property. See **Doe v. New Bedford Housing Authority**, 417 Mass. 273, 276 (1994).  

20. Pursuant to **Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14**, a landlord is liable for any restriction of a tenant’s quiet enjoyment caused by an act or omission, whether intentional or negligent.  

21. Defendant has failed to adequately address the ongoing water intrusion and the resulting mold and odor issues, which have substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises.  

22. The water intrusion has caused significant damage to Plaintiff’s personal property and has forced her to live in unsanitary conditions.

23. Defendant’s repeated inaction in the face of Plaintiff’s complaints amounts to a willful or negligent violation of Plaintiff’s rights under **Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14**.

24. Defendant’s conduct has caused Plaintiff to suffer economic damages, including property damage, and non-economic damages, including the loss of use and enjoyment of her home and emotional distress.  

25. Plaintiff is entitled to three times her actual damages plus attorneys’ fees and costs under **Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14**.

2. Award damages in the amount of **$900** to compensate Plaintiff for the replacement cost of her damaged laptop.
