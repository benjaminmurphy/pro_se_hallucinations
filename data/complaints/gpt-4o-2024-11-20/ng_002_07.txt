**COMPLAINT**  

**INTRODUCTION**  
This is a civil action brought by Plaintiff Emily Carter against Defendant John Mitchell seeking damages for injuries and losses sustained as a direct result of the Defendant’s negligence in failing to control his unleashed dog, which caused Plaintiff to suffer serious physical injuries.

**PARTIES**  
1. Plaintiff, Emily Carter, is an individual residing in Newton, Massachusetts.  
2. Defendant, John Mitchell, is an individual who, upon information and belief, resides in Newton, Massachusetts.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
3. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19, as the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of the District Court.  
4. Venue is proper in the Newton District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1, as the incident giving rise to this claim occurred in Newton, Massachusetts.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
5. On September 15, 2023, Plaintiff Emily Carter was jogging on a marked trail inside Greenough Park, located in Newton, Massachusetts.  
6. Greenough Park is a public park maintained by the City of Newton, and posted rules at the park clearly require that all dogs must be leashed at all times.  
7. Defendant John Mitchell was present at Greenough Park on September 15, 2023, with his large dog. Upon information and belief, Defendant was approximately thirty (30) feet away from his unleashed dog and in conversation with other individuals.  
8. Although Defendant had a leash in his possession, he failed to leash his dog, allowing it to roam freely.  
9. Suddenly, Defendant’s dog began barking loudly and charged toward Plaintiff as she was jogging along the path.  
10. Fearing that the dog might attack or bite her, Plaintiff swerved off the path to avoid the dog’s approach.  
11. In doing so, Plaintiff tripped over a tree root, causing her to fall down a small embankment.  
12. As a result of the fall, Plaintiff suffered serious injuries, including a fractured wrist and multiple bruises.  
13. Plaintiff was taken to an emergency room, incurred medical expenses totaling approximately $5,500, and lost income of approximately $2,000 due to her inability to work.  
14. Defendant’s conduct, including failing to leash his dog and prevent it from intimidating other park users, directly caused Plaintiff’s injuries.  

**COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE**  
15. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all prior paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.  
16. Defendant had a duty under Massachusetts law, including Newton park regulations and common law, to exercise reasonable care in controlling his dog to ensure it did not create a risk of harm to others.  
17. Defendant breached this duty by failing to leash his dog and allowing it to roam freely in violation of Greenough Park’s rules, unreasonably placing others at risk of injury.  
18. The foreseeability of harm as a result of Defendant’s failure to leash his dog was clear, as unleashed dogs can cause fear, injury, or dangerous actions by others seeking to avoid them.  
19. Defendant’s breach of duty was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s fall and subsequent injuries.  
20. Plaintiff’s injuries, including a fractured wrist and serious bruising, were foreseeable harms resulting from Defendant’s negligent conduct.  
21. Massachusetts courts have consistently held defendants liable for injuries caused by their failure to properly control their dogs, including cases involving unleashed dogs, as in *Blais v. Berean* 215 Mass. 538 (1913) (dog owner liable for injuries caused indirectly by dog’s conduct); *Munn v. Hotchkiss*, 247 Mass. 79 (1923) (failure to restrain dog may constitute negligence where injury is reasonably foreseeable); *Fitzgerald v. Connolly*, 418 Mass. 161 (1994) (requiring dog owners to exercise reasonable care to prevent harm caused by dogs).  
22. Defendant further breached his duty under G.L. c. 140, § 167, which requires dog owners to control their animals. Failure to comply with an applicable statutory duty constitutes prima facie evidence of negligence under Massachusetts law as outlined in *Walsh v. Ogorzalek*, 372 Mass. 271 (1977).  
23. The failure to leash a dog in violation of posted park rules also constitutes negligence per se under Massachusetts law.  

**DAMAGES**  
24. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has sustained the following damages:  
   a. Medical expenses in the approximate amount of $5,500;  
   b. Lost wages in the approximate amount of $2,000;  
   c. Severe pain and suffering as a result of her injuries.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grant the following relief:  
1. Judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant for all damages resulting from Defendant’s negligence, including but not limited to:  
   a. Medical expenses in the amount of $5,500;  
   b. Lost wages in the amount of $2,000;  
   c. Pain and suffering in an amount to be determined by the Court;  
2. Costs of this action, including attorney’s fees as allowed by law;  
3. Any further relief that this Court deems just and proper.  

**DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL**  
Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all claims so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,  

Dated: December 1, 2025
