      "support_confidence": "high",
      "support_reasoning": "The case analyzes whether the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, specifically \u00a7 10(j), bars liability for alleged negligence; it expressly assumes negligence for purposes of the motion to dismiss and focuses only on sovereign immunity. The court does not discuss or recognize any specific common-law duty of care to ensure children\u2019s safety or to provide proper supervision during activities. Indeed, the opinion holds that even if the school was negligent in failing to protect the student, the public defendants are immune, which does not support the asserted duty proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThus, the issue that we must decide is not whether the school was negligent for failing to act reasonably to prevent the bullying that led to Matthew's injuries; the complaint alleges that it was, and for purposes of this appeal, we accept that allegation as true. Rather, the issue on appeal is whether, under the act, the public defendants may be held liable for that negligence. We conclude that the act protects them from liability for such negligence.\u201d"

      "support_reasoning": "The proposition concerns the existence of serious injuries and proximate causation between a defendant\u2019s negligence and those injuries. Leavitt v. Brockton Hosp. addresses duty and the scope of foreseeable risk (proximate cause) in a very different factual setting and ultimately holds that the plaintiff officer\u2019s injuries were not within the scope of foreseeable risk and thus not legally caused by the hospital\u2019s alleged negligence. The case does not recognize or support a general statement that a defendant\u2019s negligence caused the listed types of injuries; instead, it denies causation on similar grounds, so it is contrary authority for the cited proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe hospital also claims that it should not be held liable on a separate, independent ground: the injury to Leavitt was not \u2018caused\u2019 by any action on its part. We agree. Leavitt\u2019s injury was not \u2018caused\u2019 by the hospital because it falls outside the scope of foreseeable risk arising from any negligent conduct that would make the hospital\u2019s alleged misconduct tortious.\u201d"
