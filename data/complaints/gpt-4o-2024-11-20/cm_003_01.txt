v.  

**Michael Carter,**  
*Defendant.*

**Complaint for Modification**  

**Now Comes the Plaintiff, Emily Carter,** and respectfully states and alleges the following in support of her Complaint for Modification in accordance with G.L. c. 208, § 28, and relevant Massachusetts case law:

### **Parties**
1. The Plaintiff, Emily Carter, resides at [Insert Emily’s address], within the jurisdiction of the Middlesex Probate and Family Court.  
2. The Defendant, Michael Carter, resides at [Insert Michael’s address], similarly within the jurisdiction of this Court.  
3. The parties are the parents of a minor child, Jacob Carter, born [Insert Date of Birth].  

### **Jurisdiction**
4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 209C, § 20 and G.L. c. 208, §§ 19 and 28, as both parties and the minor child reside in Middlesex County, and the original custody judgment was entered in this Court on May 10, 2021.

### **Prior Custody Order**
5. On May 10, 2021, this Court entered a judgment granting the parties shared legal custody of Jacob Carter, with primary physical residence with the Plaintiff and parenting time for the Defendant on alternate weekends and other specific times as determined by the order.  
6. At the time of the prior judgment, the Court found that both parents were able to co-parent effectively and prioritized the child’s health, safety, and welfare under the principles espoused in G.L. c. 208, § 31, identifying shared custody as being in the best interest of the minor child.  

### **Material Change in Circumstances**
7. Since the May 10, 2021 judgment, there has been a material change in circumstances that adversely impacts the minor child, necessitating a modification in the custody arrangement to ensure his safety and welfare:  

   a. The Plaintiff has recently observed concerning behaviors exhibited by the Defendant that appear incompatible with the ability to safely parent the minor child.  
   b. Plaintiff has received multiple alarming statements from Jacob, including references to "special drinks" at the Defendant’s residence and occasions where the Defendant “can’t walk straight.”  
   c. A concerned neighbor provided video evidence of the Defendant stumbling while managing the minor child late at night, which casts doubt on the Defendant’s fitness for overnight parenting time.  
   d. Jacob’s school has reported that he frequently appears fatigued on Monday mornings, raising further questions about the quality of supervision and care provided during the Defendant’s parenting time.  

8. Plaintiff believes the Defendant’s conduct constitutes a material change in circumstances as defined in Massachusetts jurisprudence, including but not limited to *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012), where the Supreme Judicial Court emphasized the Court’s duty to intervene when substantial evidence indicates harm or risk to a child’s best interests.

9. The Plaintiff respectfully avers that modifying the custody arrangement is in the best interests of the minor child under the standard established in *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985), and further supported by the rationale in *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003), which requires courts to prioritize the safety and welfare of children in all custody mattes.  

### **Legal Basis for Modification**
10. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, modification of a prior custody order is warranted when there is evidence of a material and substantial change in circumstances and the proposed modification is in the best interests of the child.  
11. Massachusetts courts have repeatedly held that a parent’s inability to provide a safe and stable environment for their child, particularly when linked to substance abuse concerns, constitutes sufficient grounds for custody modification. See, e.g., *Blixt v. Blixt*, 437 Mass. 649 (2002), and *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540 (2010).  

### **Relief Requested**
12. Based on the material changes outlined above, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court modify the custody order entered on May 10, 2021, as follows:  
   a. Award the Plaintiff exclusive legal custody of the minor child, Jacob Carter;  
   b. Limit the Defendant’s parenting time to supervised visitation until such time as the Defendant can demonstrate that the safety concerns for the minor child have been adequately addressed;  
   c. Alternatively, impose appropriate conditions on the Defendant’s parenting time, including but not limited to a prohibition on alcohol consumption before or during any parenting time and compliance with random alcohol or substance use screening; and  
   d. Grant any other relief this Court deems just and proper in the best interests of Jacob Carter.  

### **Prayer for Relief**
**WHEREFORE,** the Plaintiff, Emily Carter, respectfully prays that this Honorable Court:  
1. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the May 10, 2021 custody order;  
2. Modify the custody arrangement in the manner set forth above; and  
3. For such further relief this Court deems appropriate and in the best interests of the minor child.  

Respectfully submitted,
