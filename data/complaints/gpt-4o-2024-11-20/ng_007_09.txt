### FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

5. Defendant operates an after-school childcare program advertised to parents as being a safe and supervised environment for children. Defendant specifically states that children in its care will be supervised at all times.  
6. On or about March 15, 2023, Plaintiff’s eight-year-old son, J.J., was participating in Defendant's after-school program held in the gymnasium of the Brockton Community Center.  
7. According to Defendant's internal policies, twenty children such as those present on March 15, 2023, required supervision by at least two staff members.  
8. Despite the program's policies and advertisements, only one staff member remained present in the gymnasium after the second staff member left to complete paperwork in an office area. The remaining staff member failed to properly monitor the children, as demonstrated by her looking at her phone near the bleachers for extended periods.  
9. Two older children in the program began playing an unsanctioned and rough tackle game on the hardwood floor. Despite complaints from other children, including warnings to the supervising staff member, she negligently dismissed the situation by stating, "boys will be boys."  
10. J.J., who is smaller for his age, was then tackled to the ground by one of the older boys involved in the reckless game. J.J. struck his head on the gymnasium floor and was rendered unconscious for approximately thirty seconds.  
11. J.J. was admitted to the emergency room, where he was diagnosed with a concussion. J.J. experienced dizziness, confusion, and pain in the days following the incident and was unable to attend school for several days.  
12. Plaintiff incurred significant medical expenses for J.J.’s treatment, totaling approximately $5,800, and additionally lost $1,200 in wages due to needing to care for J.J. during his recovery.  
13. Defendant’s failure to adequately supervise the children in its care directly caused J.J.’s injuries.

### CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Negligence**  

14. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  
15. Under Massachusetts law, a childcare provider owes a duty of reasonable care to children in its custody and care. (See *Leonzio v. Palmer*, 70 Mass. App. Ct. 151, 155 (2007); *Alioto v. Marnell*, 402 Mass. 36, 40 (1988)).  
16. Defendant negligently breached this duty by:  
   a. Reducing staff supervision below its advertised and required standard for the number of children in the program on March 15, 2023.  
   b. Failing to take reasonable action to prevent dangerous and unsanctioned physical activity during the program.  
   c. Ignoring complaints from other children regarding unsafe conduct in the gymnasium.  
   d. Failing to engage actively in proper supervision, as evidenced by the supervisor’s inattentiveness and use of her mobile device.  
17. The injuries suffered by J.J. were a foreseeable consequence of Defendant's failure to provide reasonable supervision, as Massachusetts courts recognize that injury to children is likely when supervision duties are neglected. (See *Fisher v. Emerson College*, 89 Mass. App. Ct. 451, 455 (2016)).  
18. Defendant’s negligence was the proximate cause of J.J.’s injuries, resulting in economic and non-economic damages to Plaintiff, including medical costs, lost wages, emotional distress, and pain and suffering. (See *Santana v. Rainbow Cleaners, Inc.*, 969 Mass. 265, 268 (1988)).

### DAMAGES  

19. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff and J.J. incurred the following damages:  
   a. Medical expenses in the amount of approximately $5,800.  
   b. Lost wages in the amount of approximately $1,200.  
   c. Pain and suffering experienced by J.J. due to the concussion caused by Defendant's negligence.  
   d. Emotional distress suffered by Plaintiff due to his son’s injuries and recovery.  
20. Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages in an amount sufficient to make him and J.J. whole, including but not limited to the exact financial losses detailed above, as well as damages for emotional distress and pain and suffering.  
21. Plaintiff also seeks costs associated with bringing this action where authorized by law.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Ethan Johnson, individually and on behalf of his minor child, J.J., respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  
1. Enter judgment in favor of the Plaintiff and against the Defendant Brockton Community Center;
