**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

7. On or about March 1, 2022, the Plaintiff entered into a residential lease agreement with the Defendant to rent the basement unit at 27 Maple Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts, for $1,200 per month.  

8. The Plaintiff has regularly paid her rent, except for one instance in October 2025 when she was approximately two weeks late due to unforeseen medical expenses. The Plaintiff subsequently paid her rent in full, along with the imposed late fee.  

9. In November 2025, the Plaintiff observed water seeping into the basement unit during periods of heavy rain. Plaintiff notified the Defendant of this issue via text message, but the Defendant took no steps to remediate the problem.  

10. After weeks of inaction by the Defendant, the Plaintiff contacted the City of Boston’s Inspectional Services Department (“ISD”). Upon inspection, ISD identified the water penetration issue in the unit and noted additional code violations.  

11. Due to the water seepage, the Plaintiff’s rug and bookshelf, valued at approximately $400, were irreparably damaged. Furthermore, the Plaintiff has been required to run a dehumidifier continuously to address the excess moisture in the apartment, leading to increased electricity costs.  

12. The Defendant, in apparent retaliation for the Plaintiff reporting housing code violations, informed the Plaintiff that her lease would not be renewed after its expiration in March 2026. The Defendant has claimed that this decision is due to the Plaintiff’s late rent payment in October 2025, although the Plaintiff reasonably believes the decision is retaliatory and linked to her contacting ISD.  

13. As of the date of this filing, December 1, 2025, the Defendant has not taken any steps to repair the water penetration or otherwise render the property habitable.  

14. The Defendant’s failure to address the water issue, as well as her retaliatory conduct, has caused the Plaintiff significant emotional distress, financial losses, and inconvenience, substantially interfering with her use and enjoyment of the premises.

**CAUSE OF ACTION: BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT (M.G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  

15. Plaintiff restates and incorporates by reference the allegations in Paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth herein.  

16. Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, § 14 provides that tenants are entitled to the covenant of quiet enjoyment, which prohibits landlords from interfering with tenants’ use and enjoyment of their rental units.  

17. Defendant, as Plaintiff’s landlord, violated the covenant of quiet enjoyment by failing to maintain the premises in a habitable and safe condition, including allowing water to seep into the unit and failing to remedy the issue after notice.  

18. The Defendant further violated the covenant of quiet enjoyment by engaging in retaliatory conduct, including refusing to renew Plaintiff’s lease in response to her lawful exercise of her rights to report code violations to ISD.  

19. Defendant’s actions and inactions have resulted in substantial interference with Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy her residence, causing economic and emotional harm.  

20. Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover actual damages, three times the amount of actual damages due to the Defendant’s willful conduct, and reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.

B. Treble damages pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, for Defendant’s willful and knowing interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment;  

C. An award of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs as permitted under M.G.L. c. 186, § 14;
