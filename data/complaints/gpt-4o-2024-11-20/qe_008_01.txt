C.A. No. _______________  
___  

### COMPLAINT

### INTRODUCTION  
This is a civil complaint brought by Plaintiff Emily Thompson against her landlord, John Ramirez, for breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law. As a result of the Defendant's failure to maintain the premises in a secure condition, Plaintiff has suffered losses and harm, including a stolen package, security concerns, and the cost of mitigating Defendant's inadequacies.

### PARTIES  
1. Plaintiff Emily Thompson ("Plaintiff") resides at 45 Broadway St, Chelsea, MA 02150, where she has rented an apartment since January 15, 2022.  
2. Defendant John Ramirez ("Defendant") is the owner and landlord of the rental premises located at 45 Broadway St, Chelsea, MA 02150, and is responsible for maintaining the premises in compliance with all applicable laws.  

### JURISDICTION AND VENUE  
3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19, as the damages claimed are less than $50,000.  
4. Venue is proper in Chelsea District Court under G.L. c. 223, § 1, as the rental property and the acts and omissions giving rise to this action occurred in Chelsea, Massachusetts.

### FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  
5. Plaintiff commenced her tenancy at the rental unit located at 45 Broadway St, Chelsea, MA 02150, on January 15, 2022, pursuant to a verbal lease agreement with Defendant. Plaintiff currently pays $1,500 per month in rent.  
6. The main entry door to the apartment building contains a lock that is broken and does not latch properly, allowing unauthorized individuals to easily enter the premises.  
7. Plaintiff first notified Defendant of the broken lock approximately two months ago and requested repair. Defendant acknowledged the issue and stated he would fix it.  
8. Despite Defendant's assurances, the lock has not been repaired, and Plaintiff has reminded Defendant twice of the issue.  
9. On or about November 1, 2025, an unauthorized individual entered the building and stole packages located in the common hallway. Plaintiff lost a package valued at approximately $120 as a result of this theft.  
10. Around the same time, Plaintiff observed evidence suggesting that an unauthorized individual had been sleeping in the building's basement, further heightening her concern for safety.  
11. To address Defendant's failure to provide adequate security, Plaintiff incurred out-of-pocket expenses of approximately $200 to purchase a security camera and a deadbolt lock for her apartment.  
12. Defendant continues to dismiss Plaintiff's concerns, characterizing them as an overreaction, despite the clear risks posed by an unsecure main entry door.  
13. As a result of Defendant's failure to remedy the broken lock, Plaintiff has suffered harm, including financial losses, interference with her quiet enjoyment of the premises, and emotional distress associated with safety concerns.

### CAUSE OF ACTION  
#### Count I: Breach of the Implied Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, § 14)  
14. Plaintiff restates and incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  
15. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, every residential tenancy in Massachusetts includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, which guarantees tenants the right to use and enjoy their rented premises free from substantial interference by the landlord.  
16. Defendant's failure to repair the broken lock on the building's main entry door constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff's use and enjoyment of her rental unit because it has exposed Plaintiff to security risks, led to the theft of her personal property, and created an ongoing state of insecurity within the premises.  
17. Defendant's actions and omissions amount to a violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14, which entitles Plaintiff to statutory damages of three months' rent, attorneys' fees, and costs.  
18. Defendant's neglect of his duty to maintain the premises in a safe and secure condition further violates his obligations under governing housing codes, including the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code, 105 CMR 410.000 et seq., which requires landlords to maintain entry doors in operable condition to ensure tenant safety.  
19. Defendant's breaches have caused Plaintiff actual damages, including the value of her stolen package ($120), the cost of mitigating equipment ($200), and emotional distress associated with safety concerns.  

### PRAYER FOR RELIEF  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:  
1. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff on her claim for breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment.  
2. Award Plaintiff statutory damages equal to three months' rent, totaling $4,500, pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14.  
3. Award Plaintiff actual damages in the amount of $320 for stolen property and out-of-pocket expenses.  
4. Award Plaintiff her costs and expenses incurred in bringing this action.  
5. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.
