While it condenses duty and breach into \u201cbreach of the duty to use reasonable care,\u201d the structure of the elements matches the proposition: duty, breach, causation, and actual damages. The court\u2019s analysis of why summary judgment is appropriate turns on plaintiffs\u2019 failure to prove causation, underscoring that these elements are required under Massachusetts law.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe plaintiffs argue that they presented sufficient evidence to warrant a trial of each of their negligence claims. With respect to each such claim, the plaintiffs bear the burden of proving that the defendant committed a breach of the duty to use reasonable care, that the plaintiffs suffered actual loss, and that the defendant\u2019s negligence caused their loss. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 281 (1965); J.R. Nolan & L.J. Sartorio, Tort Law \u00a7 204 (2d ed. 1989). Causation is an essential element of that proof.\u201d"

It does not concern duties of a private defendant as dog owner or as a user of a park, nor does it address premises liability or animal ownership. Accordingly, it cannot be cited as authority for a duty of care arising from dog ownership or park usage.\n",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"We conclude that there is a special relationship between a police officer who negligently fails to remove an intoxicated motorist from the highway, and a member of the public who suffers injury as a result of that failure. The statutes which establish police responsibilities in such circumstances evidence a legislative intent to protect both intoxicated persons and other users of the highway.\""

Pine Manor College is a premises/security case about a college\u2019s alleged negligent security and locking systems leading to a rape, and this excerpt is a dissent arguing that proximate cause was *not* established. It neither involves a dog nor supports a finding that negligence proximately caused the plaintiff\u2019s injuries; instead, it emphasizes the speculative nature of causation and that the plaintiff failed to prove proximate cause.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cTherefore, the plaintiff failed to show that the defendants\u2019 negligent failure to exclude possible intruders from the plaintiff\u2019s dormitory proximately caused her injury. \u2026 The plaintiff had the burden of proving \u2018that the defendant[s] took a risk with respect to the plaintiff\u2019s safety that a person of ordinary prudence would not have taken, and that the plaintiff suffered a resulting injury that was within the foreseeable risk.\u2019 \u2026 In my opinion the plaintiff failed to introduce sufficient evidence to warrant a finding that action or inaction of the defendants was the proximate cause of her injury.\u201d"

Instead, it focuses on summary judgment standards and the plaintiff\u2019s inability to produce evidence of a defect or causation. There is no discussion of whether the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were a foreseeable result of any conduct by the defendants, so the case does not support the stated proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe plaintiff had the burden of proof at trial on the question whether her alleged personal injury and property loss were due to a defect in the manufacture or design of her automobile. \u2026 [T]he plaintiff\u2019s appellate argument is without merit. \u2026 [E]ven without expert testimony, she can [not] prove her case by invoking the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. The common experience of mankind in no way suggests that an unexplained fire in an automobile six years after its purchase was caused by a defect in the vehicle that had existed from the time of the vehicle\u2019s manufacture or sale.\u201d"
