**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**  

TO THE HONORABLE JUDGES OF THE BRISTOL COUNTY PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT:  

Plaintiff Jennifer Lee respectfully submits this Complaint for Modification and states as follows:  

---

### **INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**  

1. Plaintiff, Jennifer Lee ("Mother"), resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the primary residential custodian of the minor child, Emily Smith, born on [Insert Date of Birth, if needed].  
2. Defendant, Michael Smith ("Father"), also resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and has regular parenting time with Emily, including substantial weekend time under the current custody order.  
3. This matter arises from the original Judgment of Custody entered by this Court on May 15, 2022, providing for joint legal custody, primary residency with the Mother, and substantial weekend parenting time for the Father.  

---

### **JURISDICTION**  

4. Jurisdiction is proper in the Probate and Family Court under G.L. c. 208, § 28 and related statutes, as this action arises from a prior custody order issued by this Court.  
5. The Court has continuing jurisdiction over modifications of custody pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28.  

---

### **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

6. The current custody order provides that both parents share joint legal custody and are required to cooperate in decisions related to the child's welfare, particularly school attendance and educational matters.  
7. Since the entry of the May 15, 2022 Judgment, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances that directly impacts the best interests of Emily Smith.  
8. Over the past year, Defendant has repeatedly kept Emily home from school on Mondays following his weekend parenting time, claiming she needs “mental health days.” These absences are not supported by any medical or psychological recommendation, nor substantiated with doctor’s notes.  
9. As a result of these repeated absences, Emily has accumulated an alarming number of unexcused absences, leading to truancy warnings issued by her school.  
10. Emily's grades and test scores have declined significantly, in stark contrast to her prior academic performance, which showed typical achievement for her grade level at the time the original order was entered.  
11. Defendant has also refused to bring Emily to critical tutoring sessions when they fall during his court-ordered parenting time. These tutoring sessions were specifically recommended by her teachers to help address her recent academic struggles.  
12. This refusal and neglect by Defendant not only violate the original Judgment's directive to cooperate in decisions related to Emily's school and education but also undermine her educational prospects.  
13. The cumulative impact of Defendant’s actions has directly and negatively affected Emily’s academic progress, educational stability, and ultimate well-being.  

---

### **LEGAL STANDARD FOR MODIFICATION**  

14. Under Massachusetts law, courts may modify custody orders where there is a material and substantial change in circumstances that affects the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012).  
15. The best interests of the child is the paramount concern in all custody modification proceedings. See *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).  

---

### **APPLICATION OF LAW TO FACTS**  

16. The Defendant’s repeated failure to ensure Emily’s school attendance and refusal to take her to tutoring sessions is a material and substantial change in circumstances that was not anticipated at the time of the May 15, 2022 Judgment.  
17. Defendant’s actions violate the obligation to cooperate on educational matters as outlined in the custody judgment and demonstrate that Defendant has prioritized his personal discretion over Emily’s best interests.  
18. The deterioration in Emily’s grades and academic performance as a direct consequence of Defendant’s actions indisputably impacts her welfare and educational development, thereby satisfying Massachusetts’ standard for modification of custody orders. See *Custody of Zia*, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 237 (2000).  
19. In situations where one parent’s actions threaten the child’s well-being or future prospects, the Court has consistently held that custody orders should be modified to serve the child’s best interests. See *Brazy v. Brazy*, 85 Mass. App. Ct. 903 (2014); *Felix v. Felix*, 97 Mass. App. Ct. 714 (2020).  

---

### **RELIEF REQUESTED**  

20. In light of the above, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter a judgment modifying the custody order to:  
   a. Grant the Plaintiff sole decision-making authority regarding Emily’s school attendance and educational matters, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28.  
   b. Adjust the Defendant’s parenting time such that Emily is no longer required to stay overnight with Defendant on Sunday evenings during the school year.  
   c. Order any other relief this Court deems appropriate and in the best interests of the minor child.  

---

### **CONCLUSION**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jennifer Lee respectfully requests that this Honorable Court find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances and issue an order modifying the custody judgment as outlined above, to protect and serve the best interests of Emily Smith.
