It further explains that liability arises only if the owner has actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition for sufficient time to remedy it, which presupposes a duty to inspect and remedy hazards within a reasonable time. Although Sheehan adopts the mode-of-operation approach, it expressly reaffirms this traditional Massachusetts principle.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Historically, Massachusetts has also followed the traditional approach governing premises liability. A store owner has been required to maintain its property \"in a reasonably safe condition in view of all the circumstances, including the likelihood of injury to others, the seriousness of the injury, and the burden of avoiding the risk.\" Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 708 (1973). However, the law has afforded store owners a reasonable opportunity to discover and correct any hazards before liability attaches. \u2026 This court has thus held that premises liability attaches only if a store owner has actual or constructive notice of the existence of the dangerous condition, sufficient to allow time for the owner to remedy the condition."

The court holds that the jury could find the store negligent because the condition existed long enough and in such a way that the defendant, through reasonable care, should have discovered and remedied it. That directly supports a proposition that a property owner is liable when its failure to act allows a dangerous condition to persist and cause injury.",

[T]he jury could have found that the mound of squash ... had been on the floor long enough to have been removed before the accident, and that it had remained on the floor until the time of the injury because of negligence of the defendant.\""

The dissent does not dispute that the defendants\u2019 negligence, including actions and inactions of employees (e.g., campus security, supervision of guards), could create liability; it only argues the evidence did not sufficiently prove that such negligence caused the harm. Thus the case, as a whole, recognizes that a property owner may be liable when employees\u2019 negligent performance of their duties leads to harm.",
