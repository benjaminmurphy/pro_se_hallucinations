Plaintiff,  

v.  

**Michael Johnson,**  
Defendant.  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

**INTRODUCTION**  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Laura Smith, and respectfully submits this Complaint for Modification pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and related statutes and caselaw. The Plaintiff seeks to modify the existing custody and parenting time order entered on August 15, 2019, by this Honorable Court. There has been a material and substantial change in circumstances that warrants a modification in the child’s best interests.  

**PARTIES**  
1. Plaintiff, Laura Smith, resides at [Plaintiff’s address], in [Town], Massachusetts, and is the mother of Emily Johnson, age 8.  
2. Defendant, Michael Johnson, resides at [Defendant’s address] on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and is the father of Emily Johnson.  

**FACTUAL BACKGROUND**  
3. On August 15, 2019, this Honorable Court entered a custody and parenting time order awarding Plaintiff primary physical custody of Emily Johnson, with Defendant having parenting time every other weekend and one midweek overnight on Wednesdays.  
4. At the time the original order was entered, both Plaintiff and Defendant resided in the same town, making the midweek overnight reasonable and easily manageable as it involved a short five-minute commute to Emily’s school the next morning.  
5. Since the entry of the original order, Defendant has moved approximately 90 miles away, to Cape Cod. Despite this considerable change, Defendant continues to exercise the midweek overnight parenting time.  
6. Defendant’s relocation imposes an excessive burden on Emily due to the extensive travel time. Specifically, Defendant regularly picks Emily up from school on Wednesdays, drives her approximately 90 miles to Cape Cod, and wakes her up as early as 4:30 AM the following morning to drive her back to school, resulting in substantial sleep deprivation.  
7. Emily’s teacher has expressed concerns to Plaintiff about Emily’s heightened fatigue and diminished participation in school on Thursdays following the midweek overnight with the Defendant.   
8. This adverse impact on Emily’s health, academic progress, and overall well-being constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances that did not exist at the time of the 2019 custody order.  
9. Plaintiff has attempted to address these issues with Defendant through good faith discussions; however, Defendant refuses to modify the Wednesday overnight schedule or substitute alternate arrangements.  

**APPLICABLE LAW AND LEGAL ARGUMENT**  
10. Under Massachusetts law, a Probate and Family Court may modify a custody or parenting plan order upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and upon a determination that the modification is in the best interests of the child. G.L. c. 208, § 28; Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734, 738 (1996).  
11. A child’s best interests are the paramount concern when crafting or modifying custody arrangements. Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704, 710 (1985).  
12. The relocation of a parent, which results in a disruptive impact on the child’s health, education, or well-being, constitutes a significant change in circumstances that can justify a modification of a parenting time order. See Hunter v. Rose, 463 Mass. 488, 493 (2012); Rosenwasser v. Rosenwasser, 89 Mass. App. Ct. 473, 474 (2016).  
13. Transporting a child on lengthy, burdensome car trips that interfere with school performance and adequate rest has been recognized as contrary to the best interests of a child. See Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 102, 110 (2010).  
14. Courts may also modify a parenting schedule when a parent's inflexible insistence on implementing damaging arrangements shows disregard for the child's best interests. See Blixt v. Blixt, 437 Mass. 649, 658 (2002).  
15. Plaintiff’s request to eliminate the midweek overnight and adjust the weekend schedule is a reasonable modification that seeks to prioritize Emily’s health, academic performance, and overall well-being, consistent with the caselaw affirming the importance of a stable, supportive environment for children. See Felton v. Felton, 383 Mass. 232, 233 (1981); Haas v. Puchalski, 9 Mass. App. Ct. 555, 558 (1980).  

**REQUEST FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Laura Smith, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the custody order on August 15, 2019;  
2. Determine that the existing midweek overnight parenting schedule is no longer in the best interests of the minor child, Emily Johnson;  
3. Modify the parenting time order by eliminating the Wednesday midweek overnight and crafting a new schedule that reduces burdensome travel on Emily;  
4. Make any further orders that this Court deems fair, equitable, and in the best interests of the minor child; and  
5. Schedule a hearing to resolve this matter as soon as practicable.  

Respectfully submitted,
