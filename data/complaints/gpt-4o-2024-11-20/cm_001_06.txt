   Defendant.

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**  

**1. INTRODUCTION**  
This is a Complaint for Modification brought under G.L. c. 208, § 28, and G.L. c. 209C, § 20, to amend the custody and parenting time provisions of the prior judgment entered by this Court on May 15, 2020. Plaintiff Laura Jenkins respectfully requests that the Court modify the existing custody and parenting schedule to reflect a material change in circumstances affecting the best interests of the parties’ minor children, Sophie Jenkins (born [DOB]) and Ethan Jenkins (born [DOB]).

**2. PARTIES**  
**a. Plaintiff:** Laura Jenkins resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of Sophie Jenkins and Ethan Jenkins.  
**b. Defendant:** Michael Jenkins resides in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the same minor children.  

**3. PRIOR PROCEEDINGS**  
On May 15, 2020, this Court issued a custody and parenting time order granting Plaintiff primary custody of Sophie and Ethan, with Defendant receiving parenting time every other weekend and one overnight on a weekday.  

**4. JURISDICTION**  
This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 209C, § 20, and G.L. c. 208, § 28, as the parties and the children have been residents of Massachusetts since the original judgment entered, and Massachusetts remains the children's home state within the meaning of G.L. c. 209B (the Massachusetts Child Custody Jurisdiction Act).

**5. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**  
Plaintiff asserts that material and substantial changes in circumstances, outlined below, render the current custody arrangement no longer in the best interest of the minor children, necessitating modification:  

a. **Defendant’s Change in Employment:** At the time of the original order, both parents worked regular daytime schedules, and the parenting plan appropriately balanced each parent’s availability to effectively care for the children. However, Defendant has since taken a new job requiring him to work overnight shifts from 7 PM to 7 AM, which often coincide with his scheduled parenting time, including weekday overnights.  

b. **Defendant’s Inability to Exercise Parenting Time:** Defendant has failed to exercise his scheduled parenting time on numerous occasions, as he is unable to provide direct care for the children due to his work schedule or exhaustion after completing his shifts. Defendant often drops the children off at Plaintiff’s home with little-to-no notice, shifting the burden of childcare to Plaintiff outside the agreed-upon parenting schedule.  

c. **Inappropriate Delegation of Childcare Responsibilities:** When Defendant is unavailable due to his work schedule, he has, on occasion, left the children in the care of his roommate, a person Plaintiff barely knows and whose ability to provide appropriate care is uncertain. Such delegation raises significant concerns about the children’s safety and well-being.  

d. **Impact on the Children:** The minor children, Sophie and Ethan, have expressed that they frequently fall asleep on the couch while Defendant naps after his shifts instead of receiving the consistent parental care and routines they need. This lack of structure is disruptive to their overall well-being and development.  

**6. RELIEF REQUESTED**  
In light of the above-stated material changes in circumstances, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:  
a. Modify the custody and parenting time order to ensure that Defendant’s parenting time occurs only on days when he is not working or recovering from overnight shifts.  
b. Enter an order requiring Defendant to provide reasonable advance notice to Plaintiff if he cannot exercise his scheduled parenting time.  
c. Enter any other orders the Court deems appropriate to serve the children’s best interests.  

**7. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION**  
Under Massachusetts law, the Court may modify a custody or parenting order if there has been a material change in circumstances and such modification is in the children’s best interests. See *Schechter v. Schechter*, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015). The Court must prioritize the "best interests of the child" standard pursuant to *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006), while also ensuring that both parents fulfill their shared duties to cooperatively meet the children’s needs.  

In this case:  
- Defendant’s new employment schedule creates a substantial interference with his ability to meet his parental responsibilities, as outlined in *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).  
- Frequent delegations of childcare responsibilities to unrelated third parties, such as Defendant’s roommate, conflict with the principles articulated in *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012), which emphasize the importance of a stable and supportive environment for children.  
- The unpredictability of Defendant’s parenting time disrupts the children’s routines, contrary to the guidance provided in *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003), which underscores the importance of stability and continuity.  

Furthermore, Defendant’s inability or failure to exercise parenting time as ordered by the Court constitutes a substantial change in circumstances under *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540 (2010). The Court has consistently recognized that adjustments to parenting plans must reflect the realities of parents’ schedules and capacity to fulfill their obligations (*Rubin v. Rubin*, 71 Mass. App. Ct. 48 (2008); *Ireland v. Smith*, 451 Mass. 546 (2008)).  

**8. CONCLUSION**  
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:  
a. Modify the existing custody and parenting order in accordance with the relief requested in Section 6 of this Complaint.  
b. Schedule a hearing on this Complaint.  

Respectfully submitted,
