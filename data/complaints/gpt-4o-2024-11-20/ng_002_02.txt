**STATEMENT OF FACTS**

6. On May 15, 2023, Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, was jogging on a designated path at Highland Park in Newton, Massachusetts.  
7. Highland Park is a public recreation area owned and maintained by the City of Newton, where all dogs are required to be leashed under Massachusetts General Laws and local ordinances.  
8. Defendant Michael Thompson was present at Highland Park with his large dog, which was not on a leash at the time despite the presence of signs requiring dogs to be restrained.  
9. As the Plaintiff was jogging on the designated path, Defendant’s dog suddenly charged at her, barking loudly and running toward her in an aggressive manner.  
10. The Defendant was standing approximately thirty feet away, talking with friends, and holding the leash, which was not attached to his dog.  
11. Feeling threatened by the charging dog and fearing for her safety, Plaintiff swerved off the jogging path to avoid contact with the dog.  
12. In doing so, Plaintiff tripped over a tree root and fell down a small embankment, sustaining serious injuries.  
13. As a direct and proximate result of the fall, Plaintiff suffered a broken wrist and was evaluated and treated at a local emergency room.  
14. Plaintiff incurred approximately $4,500 in medical expenses related to the diagnosis and treatment of her broken wrist.  
15. Plaintiff also lost approximately $1,200 in wages due to her inability to work while recovering from her injuries.  
16. Plaintiff furthermore was unable to perform in a piano recital for which she had been practicing, causing her significant emotional distress and loss of enjoyment of life.  
17. Defendant’s failure to properly leash and control his dog was the direct and proximate cause of the Plaintiff’s injuries.

**CAUSE OF ACTION – NEGLIGENCE**

18. Plaintiff reasserts and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1-17 of the Complaint as if fully set forth herein.  
19. Under Massachusetts law, negligence occurs when a party breaches a duty of care owed to another party, thereby causing injury. See *Payton v. Abbott Labs*, 386 Mass. 540, 548 (1982).  
20. At all relevant times, Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to act reasonably to prevent harm. See *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694, 696-97 (2000) (“A landowner or other responsible party has a duty of care to prevent foreseeably dangerous conditions that result in injury to lawful visitors.”).  
21. Defendant’s conduct is governed by M.G.L. c. 140, § 157, which mandates that dog owners restrain and control their animals to prevent harm to others.  
22. Defendant also violated Newton City Ordinance 4-5, which requires that dogs be leashed in public parks.  
23. Defendant breached his duty of care by failing to properly leash and control his dog in violation of both state and local law.  
24. It was foreseeable that Defendant’s failure to leash and control his dog in a public park would cause an ordinary person, including Plaintiff, to take evasive action and potentially sustain harm. See *Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637, 640-41 (1996) (“The foreseeability of the harm is the key touchstone of liability for negligence.”).  
25. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of duty, Plaintiff suffered physical injuries, financial losses, and emotional harm.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:  
   A. Compensatory damages in the amount of $5,700 for medical expenses, lost wages, and other economic losses;  
   B. Damages for pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life in an amount to be determined at trial;
