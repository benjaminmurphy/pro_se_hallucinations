**EMILY CARTER**, Plaintiff    
v.    
**LAURA BENNETT**, Defendant    

---

**COMPLAINT**  

**INTRODUCTION**  
This is a civil action brought by Plaintiff Emily Carter against her landlord, Defendant Laura Bennett, for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law. Defendant failed to maintain the rental premises in a habitable condition, resulting in a mold infestation that has adversely affected Plaintiff's health, property, and enjoyment of her home. Defendant's conduct violates the legal duties imposed on landlords under Massachusetts law.

**PARTIES AND JURISDICTION**  
1. Plaintiff Emily Carter is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Apartment #3, Lowell, Massachusetts, 01852 (the “Premises”).  
2. Defendant Laura Bennett is an individual residing in Massachusetts, who serves as Plaintiff's landlord with respect to the Premises.  
3. Plaintiff began renting the Premises on January 15, 2022, under a lease agreement with Defendant. Plaintiff pays $1,200 per month in rent.  
4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19, which grants the District Court authority to adjudicate civil matters where damages do not exceed $50,000. Venue is proper pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 2 and 8, as the Premises are located in Lowell, Massachusetts.

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
5. Defendant leased the Premises to Plaintiff beginning January 15, 2022.    
6. The bathroom in the Premises has no window and relies on a single exhaust fan for ventilation.  
7. In the summer of 2025, mold began to appear in the corner of the shower in Plaintiff's bathroom. The mold eventually spread to the bathroom ceiling and other areas.  
8. Plaintiff promptly informed Defendant of the mold issue and requested remediation.  
9. On inspection, Defendant dismissed Plaintiff’s concerns and blamed Plaintiff for the mold growth, claiming it resulted from inadequate use of the exhaust fan and excessive hot showers.  
10. Plaintiff regularly uses the exhaust fan while showering and occasionally enjoys longer showers, as is customary and reasonable.  
11. Despite Plaintiff’s reports of the mold infestation and its impact on her health, Defendant has refused to remedy the underlying ventilation issue to prevent further mold growth.  
12. Plaintiff has experienced significant respiratory symptoms, including coughing, congestion, and wheezing, that her doctor has attributed to the persistent mold in the bathroom. Her doctor recommended that the mold be remediated.  
13. Plaintiff was forced to dispose of personal property, including a shower curtain and towels damaged by the mold, incurring a loss of approximately $60.  
14. Defendant's failure to address the mold and improve ventilation has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises.  
15. Defendant’s refusal to fully remediate the mold and improve the ventilation constitutes a violation of the Massachusetts covenant of quiet enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, § 14).

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  

**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  
16. Plaintiff reasserts and incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs of this Complaint.  
17. Under Massachusetts law, every residential lease includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment.  
18. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, any act or omission by a landlord that substantially interferes with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of leased property constitutes a breach of that covenant.  
19. Defendant’s actions and omissions have substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises, including:  
   a. Failing to adequately remediate the mold infestation;  
   b. Failing to repair and improve the ventilation in the bathroom to prevent further mold growth; and  
   c. Dismissing Plaintiff's reasonable concerns and attributing blame to her for a condition for which Defendant is legally responsible.  
20. Defendant’s failure to act despite notice of the dangerous mold infestation violates G.L. c. 186, § 14, entitling Plaintiff to seek damages.  
21. Plaintiff has suffered health issues as a result of Defendant’s breach, including cough, congestion, and wheezing.  
22. Defendant's conduct has caused Plaintiff monetary damages, including $60 in destroyed property and $300 in damages sought for the loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises.
