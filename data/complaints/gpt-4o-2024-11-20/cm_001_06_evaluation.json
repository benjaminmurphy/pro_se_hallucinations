The opinion also emphasizes that joint custody entails mutual responsibility, joint decision-making, and a duty to cooperate and subordinate some personal preferences to make the shared-custody arrangement work.

Rather, it holds that a working, even \u2018hectic,\u2019 schedule of the custodial mother did not justify modifying custody, and that her schedule had improved by trial.

Instead, it focuses on best-interests factors such as stability of residence, flexible work schedules, wrongful removal, and parental alienation. While the court does cite a different case (Haas v. Puchalski) as an example where a parent was denied custody because the child would be cared for by multiple providers rather than the parent, that principle comes from Haas, not from Hunter itself. Thus, using Hunter as authority for the specific proposition about delegating childcare to roommates or unrelated third parties mischaracterizes the holding and reasoning of this case.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cFactors a judge may weigh are whether one parent\u2019s home is more stable in terms of a parent\u2019s work schedule, whether siblings are being raised together, and whether one parent seeks to undermine the relationship a child has with the other parent.

While the case does not discuss \u201cunpredictable parenting time\u201d in those words, its core reasoning clearly underscores the importance of stable, continuous, and minimally disrupted routines for children, which is consistent with the cited proposition.",
