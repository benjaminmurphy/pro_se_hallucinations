**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
6. Plaintiff began renting the apartment located at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, MA 01105, from Defendant as of June 1, 2022, pursuant to a lease agreement requiring monthly rent of $1,300.  

7. On or about October 15, 2025, the electrical outlets and the overhead light in one of the apartment’s two bedrooms stopped functioning.  

8. This bedroom was used by Plaintiff as a home office for remote work.  

9. Defendant was promptly notified of the electrical issue, and in response, sent an electrician to evaluate the problem.  

10. The electrician informed Plaintiff and Defendant that the issue required substantial repairs due to the age and condition of the building's wiring.  

11. Defendant subsequently informed Plaintiff that obtaining quotes and completing repairs would take time due to the complexity of the issue and the building’s wiring.  

12. As of the date of this filing, the bedroom remains unusable, with no functioning electricity.  

13. Plaintiff has been unable to use the bedroom for its intended purpose as a home office.  

14. As a result, Plaintiff has incurred costs associated with working in alternative locations. These include average daily expenses of $15 for coffee and meals at coffee shops and a coworking space membership fee of $150 per month.  

15. Plaintiff has also suffered additional loss of quiet enjoyment due to the disruption caused by moving her office equipment into the living room, further diminishing the livability of the apartment.

16. Despite Plaintiff’s repeated requests, Defendant has failed to repair the electrical issue in a timely manner, thereby depriving Plaintiff of her right to quiet enjoyment of the leased premises.

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  

**Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  
17. Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 16 as if fully set forth herein.  

18. Under Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 186, § 14, landlords are required to refrain from any conduct or omissions that interfere with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of their rental property.  

19. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has held that the covenant of quiet enjoyment protects tenants from substantial interference with the use and enjoyment of their rental premises. *Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184 (1973).  

20. The prolonged lack of functioning electricity in the bedroom constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the rental premises.  

21. The Defendant’s failure to repair this issue in a timely manner constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  

22. Massachusetts courts have held that landlords are liable for damages if their failure to remedy unsafe or uninhabitable conditions causes substantial interference with a tenant’s enjoyment. *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994); *Jablonski v. Casey*, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 744 (2005).  

23. Defendant’s delays and inaction in resolving the electrical issue have caused Plaintiff to suffer monetary damages and disruption to her ability to reside peacefully in the apartment.  

24. Plaintiff is entitled to recover damages pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, which permits recovery of actual damages or three times the monthly rent, whichever is greater, in instances of substantial interference with quiet enjoyment.  

25. Additional applicable authorities supporting this claim include: *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982) (landlord liable for failing to address tenant’s loss of essential services); *Louvier v. Maxim Commons, LLC*, 93 Mass. App. Ct. 1111 (2018) (landlord’s delay in repairing essential household systems breached quiet enjoyment); *G.L. c. 239, § 8A* (providing defenses and remedies to tenants for landlord violations).  

26. Defendant’s conduct in this matter falls squarely within the type of violations contemplated by M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, as recognized in *Fitz-Inn Auto Parks, Inc. v. Commissioner of Rent Control of Boston*, 350 Mass. 39 (1965).

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court grant the following relief:  
A. Award Plaintiff actual damages in the amount of $1,800, or such amount as may be proven at trial, as compensation for the costs incurred and the diminution of the premises’ value;  
B. Award Plaintiff statutory damages pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, including but not limited to three times the monthly rent;  
C. Award Plaintiff reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of litigation, as permitted under M.G.L. c. 186, § 14;  
D. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all triable issues.
