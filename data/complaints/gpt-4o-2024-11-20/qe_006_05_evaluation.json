However, it does not address hot water or \u2018essential utilities\u2019 generally; its reasoning and holding are specific to the non\u2011provision of heat. Thus it supports the narrower rule about heat, not the broader proposition regarding non\u2011functionality of all essential utilities, including hot water.",

See generally Blackett v. Olanoff\u2026 It is not necessary to recovery that the landlord intended to violate the covenant. Rather \u2018the landlord\u2019s conduct, and not his intentions, is controlling.\u2019\u201d"

It does not address landlord-tenant law, the covenant of quiet enjoyment, or essential utilities such as hot water. Therefore, it provides no authority for the proposition that non-functionality of essential utilities constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.",

Dartt, because of a handicap, an earlier work-related injury to his back."
