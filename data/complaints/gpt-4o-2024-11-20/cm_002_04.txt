**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**MIDDLESEX PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT DEPARTMENT**  
**DOCKET NO. [Insert Original Docket Number]**  

***MARIA TORRES,***  
**Plaintiff,**  
v.  
***JAMES CARTER,***  
**Defendant.**  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

**Introduction**  
The Plaintiff, Maria Torres, respectfully submits this Complaint for Modification pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 28A, seeking a modification of the custody and parenting time arrangement for the parties’ minor child, Sophia Carter. Since the entry of the existing Judgment dated May 15, 2021, a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred: the Defendant, James Carter, intends to relocate to New Hampshire, approximately ninety minutes away from the child’s current residence and school. This change in circumstances necessitates a modification to protect the best interests of the child by adjusting the parenting schedule to reflect the practical realities of the increased distance.

**Parties**  
1. Plaintiff, Maria Torres, resides at [Insert Address], Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139.  
2. Defendant, James Carter, currently resides at [Insert Address], Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, but has expressed an intention to relocate to [City/Town], New Hampshire.

**Factual Background**  
3. The Plaintiff and Defendant are the parents of one minor child, Sophia Carter, born on [Insert DOB], now nine years old.  
4. Pursuant to a Judgment issued by this Court on May 15, 2021, the Plaintiff was granted primary physical custody of the minor child. The Defendant was granted parenting time every Wednesday overnight and every other weekend.  
5. The parenting schedule outlined in the Judgment was based on the parties’ then-current living arrangements in or near Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the understanding that the minor child would attend school and extracurricular activities locally.  
6. The Defendant now plans to relocate to [City/Town], New Hampshire, for a job opportunity, creating a significant geographic distance between the parties. The relocation will result in a commute of approximately ninety minutes each way between the child’s primary residence and the Defendant’s proposed residence.  
7. The current parenting schedule, particularly the midweek overnight, is no longer practical given the distance. The child would be required to endure lengthy drives during school nights, which would interfere with her established routine, ability to participate in after-school activities, and overall emotional well-being.  
8. Sophia has already expressed significant anxiety about the long drives and disruption to her routine, and the Plaintiff anticipates further negative effects unless the current arrangement is modified.

**Legal Standard**  
9. A Complaint for Modification may be allowed where there is a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the existing Judgment and where modification is in the child’s best interests. G.L. c. 208, § 28; *R.H. v. B.F.*, 39 Mass. App. Ct. 29, 30 (1995).  
10. In determining the best interests of the child in a modification action, the Court considers the effect of a proposed change on the child’s stability and overall well-being. *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 183-84 (2006).  
11. Massachusetts courts have long recognized that relocation and geographic distance can constitute a material change in circumstances. *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704, 711 (1985).  
12. Parenting time schedules that interfere with a child’s ability to maintain a consistent routine, attend school, or participate in extracurricular activities are contrary to the child’s best interests. *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 259 (2001); *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 405 (1981).

**Material Change in Circumstances**  
13. Defendant’s planned relocation to New Hampshire constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances as it creates significant geographic distance, rendering the current parenting schedule impractical.  
14. The existing midweek overnight parenting time arrangement is incompatible with maintaining Sophia’s structured school routine. The child would be subjected to long commutes during school nights, negatively affecting her sleep, well-being, and ability to perform in school.  
15. The modification requested is necessary to reflect the realities of the geographical relocation and mitigate potential harm to the child.  

---

**Requested Modification**  
16. Plaintiff seeks to modify the parenting plan as follows:  
   a. The Defendant’s midweek overnight parenting time shall be removed, and in its place, Defendant shall be granted one additional weekend per month during which the parenting schedule shall commence on Friday after school and end on Sunday evening.  
   b. Summer vacation and holiday parenting time shall be reexamined, to be divided equitably between the parties while minimizing disruption to the child’s schedule.  
17. The requested modification ensures the continued stability, routine, and best interests of the child while still allowing the Defendant to maintain meaningful parenting time.  

---

**WHEREFORE**, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  
1. Enter an order modifying the existing Judgment dated May 15, 2021, consistent with the relief requested herein;  
2. Enter any further orders deemed necessary to ensure the best interests of the minor child; and  
3. Grant such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
