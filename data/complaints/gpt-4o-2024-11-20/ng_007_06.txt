*Plaintiff,*  
v.  
*Brockton Community Center,*  
*Defendant.*  

**Civil Action No.: [To Be Assigned]**

**COMPLAINT**

**INTRODUCTION**

1. The Plaintiff, Lucas Johnson, as the next friend of his minor son, A.J., brings this negligence action against the Defendant, Brockton Community Center, to recover damages arising from the Defendant’s failure to adequately supervise children in its care, resulting in a preventable injury to A.J.  

2. Plaintiff seeks recovery for his son's medical expenses, pain and suffering, and other damages caused by the Defendant's negligence.  

**PARTIES**

3. Plaintiff, Lucas Johnson, is an individual residing in Brockton, Massachusetts, and is the father of A.J., a minor child injured as a result of the Defendant's conduct.  

4. Defendant, Brockton Community Center, is a business or nonprofit entity operating at 123 Community Drive, Brockton, MA 02301, and offers an after-school program for children in the Brockton community.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

5. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 218 § 19, as this case involves claims for damages within the jurisdictional limit of the District Court.  

6. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223 § 1, because the Defendant operates its business in Brockton, Massachusetts, and the incident occurred there.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

7. On or about September 15, 2023, A.J., an 8-year-old minor, was participating in an after-school program at the Brockton Community Center’s facility located at 123 Community Drive, Brockton, MA 02301.  

8. Defendant advertised and represented to parents, including the Plaintiff, that children would be adequately supervised by staff while participating in the program’s gymnasium activities.  

9. On the date in question, the Defendant assigned two staff members to supervise about twenty children in the gymnasium.  

10. Contrary to Defendant’s policies and representations, one staff member left the gym to complete paperwork in an office, leaving only a single staff member to supervise the children.  

11. The remaining staff member failed to fulfill her duty to provide adequate supervision. She was seated near the bleachers, distracted by her phone, and disregarded reports from other children that older boys were playing a rough tackle game on the hardwood floor.  

12. The staff member dismissed concerns by responding, “boys will be boys,” failing to intervene or stop the rough play.  

13. During this unsupervised roughhousing, an older boy tackled A.J., causing him to fall and hit his head forcefully on the floor.  

14. A.J. lost consciousness for approximately thirty seconds and was immediately taken to the emergency room, where he was diagnosed with a concussion.  

15. As a result of the injury, A.J. missed multiple days of school and required medical treatment, causing Plaintiff to incur approximately $5,000 in medical expenses.  

16. Defendant’s failure to properly supervise the children, enforce safety rules, and intervene to stop dangerous behaviors directly caused A.J.'s injury.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION – NEGLIGENCE**  

17. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs as if fully stated herein.  

18. Defendant had a duty to exercise reasonable care in supervising children participating in its after-school programs to ensure their safety and prevent injury. See *Davis v. Westwood Group*, 420 Mass. 739, 742 (1995) (defining duty of care to prevent foreseeable harm); *Leavitt v. Brockton Hosp., Inc.*, 454 Mass. 37, 39 (2009).  

19. Defendant’s duty included maintaining adequate staff-to-child ratios, staying attentive to children’s activities, and intervening to prevent foreseeable dangers, including rough and unsafe play. See *Coughlin v. Pitman*, 337 Mass. 96, 99 (1958).  

20. Defendant breached its duty of care by failing to provide adequate staffing, failing to ensure active supervision of the children in its care, and failing to stop rough play that presented an obvious danger to A.J.  

21. Defendant knew or should have known that the failure to properly supervise children in a gym environment, where rough play could lead to serious injuries, created a foreseeable risk of harm. See *Butler v. Jordan*, 92 Mass. App. Ct. 116, 120 (2017).  

22. A.J.’s injuries were a foreseeable and direct result of Defendant’s negligent actions and omissions. See *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 147 (2006) (foreseeability of harm is central to negligence).  

23. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, A.J. sustained a concussion, pain and suffering, and required medical treatment, resulting in damages to Plaintiff. See *Payton v. Abbott Labs*, 386 Mass. 540, 564 (1982).  

24. Plaintiff has incurred $5,000 in medical expenses and continues to suffer damages stemming from the Defendant’s negligent supervision. See *Mathis v. Massachusetts Elec. Co.*, 409 Mass. 256, 264 (1991).  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Lucas Johnson, individually and as next friend of A.J., a minor, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment against Defendant Brockton Community Center, and award damages as follows:  

a) Compensatory damages in the amount of $5,000 for medical expenses incurred as a result of the Defendant’s negligence;  
b) Additional damages for the pain and suffering experienced by A.J.;  
c) Court costs and any other relief this Court deems just and proper.  

**JURY DEMAND**  

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
