### **Factual Allegations**  
5. On or about August 15, 2023, Plaintiff was a patron of Quincy Bistro, a restaurant owned and operated by Defendant, located at 125 Washington Street, Quincy, Massachusetts.  
6. While dining at the restaurant, a server employed by Defendant dropped a tray containing several water glasses in the hallway between the kitchen and the dining room, causing water and ice to spill onto the floor.  
7. The server proceeded to clean up the broken glass but left behind the water and ice on the tile floor and stated that she would return with a mop to clean the area further.  
8. The server failed to place any wet floor sign, warning, or other indication that the hallway floor was wet and hazardous following the spill.  
9. At least ten minutes elapsed after the spill before Plaintiff entered the hallway to use the restroom.  
10. Plaintiff slipped on the water that had been left on the tile floor, which appeared to be shiny tile but was in fact wet and hazardous.  
11. As a result of the fall, Plaintiff twisted her knee, causing a severe sprain that required medical attention, a knee brace, and physical therapy.  
12. Plaintiff incurred approximately $1,500 in medical expenses and lost approximately $2,000 in wages due to her injuries.  
13. Defendant's employees admitted to "dodging the puddle" in the hallway but failed to address the hazard, clean the spill, or warn patrons of the dangerous condition.

### **Negligence**  
14. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  
15. As the owner and operator of a business open to the public, Defendant had a duty of care to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition for patrons, including Plaintiff, and to warn of or remedy any hazards of which they knew or should have known. **See Foley v. Boston Hous. Auth., 407 Mass. 640, 646 (1990); Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973).**  
16. Defendant breached its duty of care by:  
   a. Allowing water and ice to remain on the tile floor for an extended period without cleaning it up;  
   b. Failing to warn patrons, including Plaintiff, by placing wet floor signs or other indicators of the hazardous condition; and  
   c. Failing to train or instruct its employees to immediately address and remedy unsafe conditions. **See Dos Santos v. Coleta, 465 Mass. 148, 153 (2013).**  
17. Defendant knew or reasonably should have known about the hazardous condition caused by the spilled water and ice, as its employee created the condition and its staff admitted to avoiding the puddle, thus failing to act with the reasonable care required under similar circumstances. **See Sarkisian v. Concept Rest., Inc., 471 Mass. 679, 681 (2015).**  
18. Plaintiff reasonably relied on the expectation that Defendant’s premises would be kept in a reasonably safe condition and did not reasonably foresee the hazard until she had already slipped. **See O'Sullivan v. Shaw, 431 Mass. 201, 204 (2000).**  
19. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered physical injuries, emotional distress, lost income, and medical expenses. **See Scott v. Garfield, 454 Mass. 790, 793 (2009).**

### **Damages**  
20. Plaintiff sustained the following damages as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence:  
   a. Medical expenses: approximately $1,500;  
   b. Lost wages: approximately $2,000;  
   c. Pain and suffering associated with the physical injury and recovery;  
   d. Emotional distress and diminished quality of life; and  
   e. Other incidental costs as may be shown at trial.  

---

### **Prayer for Relief**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Thompson respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment against Defendant Quincy Bistro LLC and award the following relief:  

1. An amount of damages sufficient to compensate Plaintiff for all injuries and losses sustained as a result of Defendant’s negligence, including but not limited to:  
   a. $1,500 in medical expenses;  
   b. $2,000 in lost wages; and  
   c. Additional amounts for pain and suffering, emotional distress, and any other damages as this Court deems just and proper;  
2. Pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;  
3. Reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of this action, if applicable or recoverable; and  
4. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
