v.  

**Sunny Bistro LLC**,  
Defendant.  
____________________________________  
Civil Action No. _______________________  

**COMPLAINT**  
**(Negligence)**  

**INTRODUCTION**  
1. This is a civil action for damages arising from the Defendant’s negligent maintenance of its premises, which created a dangerous condition that caused Plaintiff, Mark Johnson, to sustain serious personal injuries on September 15, 2023, at Sunny Bistro LLC, located at 123 Main Street, Quincy, Massachusetts.  

2. Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages for his physical injuries, medical expenses, lost wages, and other damages caused by Defendant’s failure to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances.  

**PARTIES**  
3. Plaintiff, Mark Johnson (hereinafter “Plaintiff”), is an individual residing in Quincy, Norfolk County, Massachusetts.  

4. Defendant, Sunny Bistro LLC (hereinafter “Defendant”), is a Massachusetts limited liability company operating a restaurant located at 123 Main Street, Quincy, Massachusetts. Defendant operates and maintains its premises for business purposes and profits by inviting the public onto its property.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
5. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, as this is a civil action in which the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000.  

6. Venue is proper in Norfolk County pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1, as the events giving rise to this Complaint occurred in Norfolk County.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
7. On September 15, 2023, Plaintiff was a customer at Defendant’s restaurant, Sunny Bistro LLC, located at 123 Main Street, Quincy, Massachusetts.  

8. While dining at Defendant’s establishment, Plaintiff walked through a narrow hallway between the kitchen and the dining room to access the restrooms.  

9. Shortly before Plaintiff entered the hallway, an employee of Defendant dropped a tray containing several water glasses onto the tile floor in the hallway, causing water and ice to spill onto the floor.  

10. Although the employee promptly picked up the broken glass from the tray, the water and ice were left on the floor, creating a slipping hazard. The employee indicated she would return with a mop but failed to do so in a timely manner.  

11. Defendant did not place any signs, cones, or other warnings to alert customers—such as Plaintiff—to the wet and hazardous condition of the floor.  

12. Approximately ten minutes after the spill, Plaintiff walked through the hallway en route to the restroom. Although the water was visible, it appeared to be a reflection of the tile rather than a hazard.  

13. As Plaintiff stepped onto the wet surface, he slipped and fell, twisting his knee in the process and falling to the ground.  

14. Following the incident, Plaintiff overheard staff members stating that they had been “dodging that puddle” for some time and were aware of its presence. Nevertheless, no measures had been taken to warn or protect Plaintiff or other customers.  

15. Plaintiff sustained a serious knee sprain in the fall, requiring medical evaluation, treatment, physical therapy, and the use of a knee brace.  

16. Plaintiff incurred medical expenses totaling approximately $1,800 for the treatment of his injuries and lost approximately $500 in wages while recovering.  

17. Defendant knew or should have known of the dangerous condition created by the spill, failed to take reasonable steps to clean or warn about the hazard, and allowed the condition to persist for an unreasonable amount of time.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**NEGLIGENCE**  
18. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 17 as if fully set forth herein.  

19. At all relevant times, Defendant owed a duty to Plaintiff, as an invitee on its premises, to maintain its property in a reasonably safe condition and to warn of any dangerous conditions that it knew or reasonably should have known about.  

20. Defendant breached its duty of care by failing to promptly clean the spill and by failing to place appropriate warnings, such as wet floor signs, to protect customers like Plaintiff from the danger posed by the wet, slippery floor.  

21. Defendant’s breach of its duty was a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries, as Plaintiff would not have slipped and fallen if the spill had been cleaned or if appropriate warnings had been provided.  

22. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered significant physical injuries, incurred substantial medical expenses, and lost income from missed work during his recovery.  

**LEGAL AUTHORITY**  
23. Defendant’s negligence constitutes a violation of its duty of care owed to Plaintiff under Massachusetts law. See *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973) (holding that property owners owe invitees a duty to keep their premises in a reasonably safe condition).  

24. Defendant’s failure to act reasonably to address a known hazard also constitutes negligence under *Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.*, 363 Mass. 165, 167 (1973) (a property owner may be liable for failing to address a dangerous condition that it knew or should have known about).  

25. Evidence of constructive knowledge, such as the length of time the hazard persisted, establishes Defendant’s liability. See *Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.*, 448 Mass. 780, 787 (2007).  

26. Failure to warn invitees about a known danger also constitutes a breach of duty under Massachusetts law. See *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368, 383 (2010).  

27. The lack of proper warning signage, such as a wet floor sign, further demonstrates Defendant’s failure to take reasonable steps to remove or mitigate the hazard. See *Young v. Atlantic Richfield Co.*, 400 Mass. 837, 842 (1987).  

28. Defendant is responsible for the actions of its employees under the doctrine of respondeat superior. See *Dias v. Brigham Med. Assocs., Inc.*, 438 Mass. 317, 319 (2002) (employers are liable for the torts of employees acting within the scope of their employment).  

29. Defendant’s failure to maintain a safe premises deprived Plaintiff of the protections afforded by G.L. c. 231, § 85 in negligence actions.  

30. Defendant’s actions fell below the standard of care owed to invitees and violated Massachusetts common law as articulated in *King v. G & M Realty Corp.*, 373 Mass. 658, 662-63 (1977).  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in his favor and against Defendant, and award the following relief:  
a. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but no less than $25,000, including past and future medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering;  
b. Costs of this action, including reasonable attorney’s fees, pursuant to applicable law;  
c. Any other or further relief that the Court deems just and proper.  

**JURY DEMAND**  
Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all claims so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,  

Dated: December 1, 2025
