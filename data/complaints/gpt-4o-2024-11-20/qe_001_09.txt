CIVIL DIVISION  

**Sarah Thompson,**  
Plaintiff,  
v.  
**William Carter,**  
Defendant.  

CIVIL ACTION NO. __________  

**COMPLAINT**  

**I. INTRODUCTION**  
1. Plaintiff Sarah Thompson (“Plaintiff”) brings this action against Defendant William Carter (“Defendant”) for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14.  

2. Plaintiff has suffered significant harm, including financial losses and health issues, as a direct result of Defendant’s failure to provide a habitable apartment free from substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises.  

**II. PARTIES**  
3. Plaintiff Sarah Thompson is an individual residing in Dorchester, Massachusetts, and is the current tenant of an apartment located at 45 Cedar Grove Road, Dorchester, MA 02124.  

4. Defendant William Carter is an individual residing in Massachusetts and is the owner and lessor of the property located at 45 Cedar Grove Road, Dorchester, MA 02124. Defendant is responsible for ensuring the property complies with all applicable housing and habitability laws.  

**III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
5. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19 and G.L. c. 223, § 2.  

6. Venue is proper in the Boston Municipal Court because the subject property is located in Dorchester, a neighborhood served by this court.  

**IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
7. Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant on August 1, 2022, to rent a two-bedroom apartment located at 45 Cedar Grove Road, Dorchester, MA 02124, for a monthly rent of $2,200.  

8. The lease agreement imposes on Defendant the obligation to maintain the premises in a habitable condition and in compliance with Massachusetts law, including the implied warranty of habitability and the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  

9. Beginning in the winter of 2024 and continuing through early 2025, the heating system in the leased premises failed to function properly, causing the indoor temperature to drop to approximately 60 degrees Fahrenheit for several hours at a time, typically in the evenings.  

10. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the heating issues, and Defendant sent repair contractors to address the problem on two occasions.  

11. Although temporary repairs were attempted, the problem persisted. Defendant’s repair contractor admitted that the boiler was "old but functional" and that further repairs were unlikely to resolve the recurring issue.  

12. During this time, Plaintiff was forced to purchase two space heaters to maintain a livable temperature, incurring added electricity expenses of approximately $150 per month.  

13. In January 2025, Plaintiff developed bronchitis, which her doctor advised was likely exacerbated by prolonged exposure to inadequate indoor heating. Plaintiff missed three days of work and incurred medical expenses for antibiotics and treatment.  

14. Defendant has refused to address the persistent heating issues effectively, contending that the heating system is functioning adequately because it never completely failed and the property is not “freezing.”  

15. Defendant’s failure to ensure adequate heat during the winter constitutes a breach of Plaintiff’s covenant of quiet enjoyment of the premises under G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

16. Plaintiff has suffered compensable damages, including increased utility costs, medical bills, and lost earnings, as a result of Defendant’s breach.  

**V. CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  

17. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  

18. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, every lease agreement in Massachusetts includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment.  

19. Defendant breached this covenant by failing to provide adequate heat, substantially interfering with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises.  

20. The failure to maintain appropriate heating levels during the winter months constitutes an unreasonable deprivation of Plaintiff's rights as a tenant under the lease and Massachusetts law.  

21. Defendant’s actions and omissions were willful or negligent and caused Plaintiff to suffer financial and physical harm, including increased electricity costs, medical bills, lost wages, and general discomfort.  

22. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Defendant is liable for actual damages or three times the monthly rent, whichever is greater, in addition to attorneys’ fees and costs.  

**VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Sarah Thompson respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment against Defendant William Carter as follows:  
1. Awarding Plaintiff damages in the amount of $600, or three times the monthly rent ($6,600), whichever is greater, as provided by G.L. c. 186, § 14;  
2. Awarding Plaintiff the costs of this action, including any applicable attorneys’ fees, as permitted under Massachusetts law;  
3. Awarding such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.  

**VII. JURY DEMAND**  
Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

Respectfully Submitted,  

**Sarah Thompson, Plaintiff**
