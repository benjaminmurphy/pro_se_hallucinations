Defendant.

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

**INTRODUCTION**  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Laura Thompson, in the above-captioned case, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court for a modification of the custody order entered on March 15, 2020, by the Middlesex County Probate and Family Court. Since the entry of the prior order, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances which warrants modification pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28. For the reasons detailed below, the Plaintiff seeks an updated custody arrangement that serves the best interests of the parties’ minor child, Sophie Davis, age 8.

---

**PARTIES**  

1. The Plaintiff, Laura Thompson (“Laura”), resides in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where she has primary custody of the parties’ minor child, Sophie Davis.  
2. The Defendant, Mark Davis (“Mark"), formerly also a resident of Cambridge, Massachusetts, now intends to relocate to New Hampshire.

**STATEMENT OF FACTS**  

3. On or about March 15, 2020, this Court entered an order granting the Plaintiff, Laura, primary physical custody of Sophie Davis, with the Defendant, Mark, receiving parenting time on Wednesday evenings and every other weekend.  
4. The original custody arrangement was predicated on both parents residing in the same geographic area (Cambridge, Massachusetts), which ensured minimal disruption to the child’s schedule and allowed Sophie to regularly attend her school and after-school activities.  
5. The Defendant has now indicated his intention to relocate to New Hampshire for a new employment opportunity, which significantly alters the feasibility of the existing parenting schedule due to the geographic distance from Sophie’s school and primary residence.  
6. The relocation to New Hampshire creates logistical challenges for Sophie’s midweek visits with Mark, as it would require Sophie to endure extended commutes of approximately ninety minutes each way during school nights.  
7. The lengthy midweek commutes would negatively affect Sophie’s ability to get adequate sleep, participate in after-school activities, and maintain a consistent and stable routine.  
8. Sophie has expressed increased anxiety about the prospect of long midweek drives and the disruption to her school and extracurricular schedule.  
9. The current custody arrangement is no longer practical or beneficial to Sophie’s best interests in light of the Defendant’s relocation.  
10. The Plaintiff previously attempted to informally resolve the issue with the Defendant to adjust the parenting schedule to better accommodate Sophie’s needs, but no mutually agreeable resolution has been reached.

**LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION**  

11. Under Massachusetts law, a custody order may be modified upon showing a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the original order, and where the modification is in the child’s best interests. See *G.L. c. 208, § 28*; *Blais v. Blais*, 428 Mass. 411 (1998).  
12. A parent’s relocation constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances that may warrant modification of parenting time if the move significantly impacts the child’s welfare or stability. See *Pizzino v. Miller*, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006); *Cooper v. Keto*, 25 Mass. App. Ct. 490 (1988).  
13. The best interests of the child are the paramount consideration in determining custody modifications, including protecting the child’s physical and emotional well-being, continuity of education, and stable routines. See *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012).  
14. Excessive travel time on school nights has been recognized by Massachusetts courts as detrimental to a child’s well-being and contrary to their best interests. See *Ventrice v. Ventrice*, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 190 (2015).  
15. In cases involving relocation and custody, courts aim to minimize disruption to the child while ensuring consistency in school attendance and extracurricular activities. See *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).  
16. Where the pre-existing order is no longer feasible or practical due to a parent’s relocation, courts may adjust the parenting schedule to reduce the burden on the child. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).  
17. The existing parenting arrangement, which includes midweek overnights, is no longer practicable due to the Defendant’s anticipated relocation to New Hampshire. Continuing this arrangement would cause unnecessary stress, sleep deprivation, disrupted routines, and harm to Sophie.  
18. As such, modification of the existing arrangement is necessary to reflect the new geographic reality and to promote the child’s best interests.

**REQUESTED RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Modify the parenting schedule to eliminate midweek overnight parenting time and replace it with an alternative schedule that reflects the Defendant’s geographic relocation and the child’s best interests.  
2. Adjust the weekend schedule, if necessary, to minimize Sophie’s travel burden and ensure adequate time with both parents.  
3. Order such other and further relief as justice and equity may require.
