**Factual Allegations**

5. On or about April 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a residential lease agreement with Defendant to rent the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Brockton, MA 02301, for a monthly rent of $1,200.  
6. The lease in question was and continues to be governed by the landlord-tenant laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including but not limited to G.L. c. 186, § 14, which ensures tenants’ rights to the quiet enjoyment of their rental premises.  
7. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is an implied term of every residential lease in Massachusetts, and its violation can give rise to remedies for damages.  
8. On or about November 10, 2025, the hot water supply at the Plaintiff’s rental unit ceased to function due to a water heater issue.  
9. Plaintiff promptly reported the issue to Defendant the same day, via text message, as is her customary method of communication with Defendant.  
10. Defendant acknowledged the issue and informed Plaintiff that the water heater required a specific part that had been ordered.  
11. Despite the Defendant’s representations, no hot water was restored in the premises for the next three weeks, through the date of the filing of this Complaint.  
12. Plaintiff continued to pay her full monthly rent during this period, even as she was deprived of basic and essential services for the habitability of her apartment.  
13. During the three-week period without hot water:  
      a. Plaintiff was forced to take cold showers in her apartment, incurring discomfort and inconvenience.  
      b. Plaintiff had to boil water to perform basic household tasks, including washing dishes.  
      c. Plaintiff incurred additional monthly expenses of $30 for a gym membership to shower, as well as costs for transportation to and from the gym.  
      d. Plaintiff was unable to safely bathe her young child at the premises and was forced to take her child to her mother’s home for baths, incurring further inconvenience and costs.  
14. Defendant’s failure to restore the hot water in a timely manner constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy the leased premises.

**Cause of Action**  
**_Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, § 14)_**

15. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth herein.  
16. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, every residential tenant in Massachusetts is entitled to the covenant of quiet enjoyment, ensuring that the landlord will not interfere with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the property.  
17. Massachusetts law provides that a landlord’s failure to maintain a habitable rental unit, including the provision of essential services such as hot water, constitutes a violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See _Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 283 (1994)._  
18. Defendant’s failure to ensure the prompt repair of the hot water system constitutes a breach of G.L. c. 186, § 14, as it seriously interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy the premises. See _Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102 (1982)._  
19. The Massachusetts courts have consistently held that essential services such as hot water are integral to the habitability of residential premises and cannot be absent for an unreasonable period without violating tenants’ rights. See _Hemingway v. James, 430 Mass. 112, 118 (1999)_.  
20. Defendant’s failure to timely restore hot water after repeated notices amounts to a “constructive eviction” in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14. See _Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184, 199 (1973)._  
21. Such breaches render Defendant liable for actual damages suffered by the Plaintiff, including but not limited to the direct economic costs of alternative arrangements and the stress, inconvenience, and indignity caused by the deprivation. See _Cruz Management Co. v. Thomas, 417 Mass. 782, 789 (1994)._

**Prayer for Relief**

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and award the following relief:  

1. Damages in the amount of $450, consisting of:  
   a. Reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses ($30 gym membership, plus transportation costs) caused by the lack of hot water.  
   b. Compensation for the inconvenience, stress, and deprivation of essential living conditions caused by Defendant’s failure to repair the water heater within a reasonable time.
2. Statutory damages pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, which provides for up to three times the Plaintiff’s actual damages, in the Court’s discretion.  
3. Attorney’s fees and costs, if applicable, pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14.  
4. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
