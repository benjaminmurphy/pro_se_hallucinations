The principal question is whether the use contemplated by Eastern for its waterfront site should properly be characterized under the zoning ordinance as a commercial dock (as the plaintiffs contend) or as a wholesale business storage and distribution area (as the city contends). Both uses are permitted in an Industrial Waterfront District under \u00a7\u00a7 4.1.3(18) and 4.1.4, respectively, of the ordinance."

The court explains that \u00a7 14 and the common-law covenant of quiet enjoyment cover substantial interferences with the tenant\u2019s tenancy caused by the landlord\u2019s acts or omissions, including failure to maintain sanitary, watertight premises, and holds the landlord liable under \u00a7 14 on that basis. Although the $10,000 quiet-enjoyment damages award is vacated as duplicative, the opinion affirms liability and attorneys\u2019 fees under the quiet enjoyment statute for failure to remedy dangerous/disruptive conditions affecting use and enjoyment.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe common law background of \u00a7 14 also suggests that malicious intent is not a condition of liability. The phrase \u2018quiet enjoyment\u2019 is a familiar term in landlord-tenant law, signifying the tenant\u2019s right to freedom from serious interferences with his tenancy \u2014 acts or omissions that \u2018impair the character and value of the leased premises.\u2019 \u2026 Finally, Gem is liable to Solomon under \u00a7 14 because it violated its underlying duty to maintain sanitary conditions in her apartment, and thereby permitted repeated flooding to occur that interfered with her quiet enjoyment of her apartment.\u201d"

The court reverses summary judgment on the quiet enjoyment claim, expressly recognizing that failure to take available measures to remove unlawful actors from common areas can constitute a breach. This squarely supports landlord liability for failing to remedy dangerous or disruptive conditions that impair tenants\u2019 quiet enjoyment.",

The court emphasizes that liability can arise from what the landlord \u201cfailed to do, or\u2026permitted to be done,\u201d and explicitly rejects a nonfeasance/malfeasance distinction in such circumstances. This directly supports the proposition that Massachusetts courts hold landlords liable for failing to remedy disruptive conditions affecting quiet enjoyment.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThere are occasions, however, where a landlord has not intended to violate a tenant\u2019s rights, but there was nevertheless a breach of the landlord\u2019s covenant of quiet enjoyment which flowed as the natural and probable consequence of what the landlord did, what he failed to do, or what he permitted to be done\u2026 Because the disturbing condition was the natural and probable consequence of the landlords\u2019 permitting the lounge to operate where it did and because the landlords could control the actions at the lounge, they should not be entitled to collect rent for residential premises which were not reasonably habitable.\u201d"

      "support_reasoning": "The opinion explicitly reaffirms that negligent failure to repair known defects or dangerous conditions can constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 14. In doing so, it cites and relies on a line of prior Massachusetts cases (Simon, Darmetko, Dorgan, Cruz, Doe) holding landlords liable where they failed to remedy conditions that interfered with tenants\u2019 use and enjoyment. Although the specific holding is that a bare statutory lead paint violation is not enough without fault, the case clearly endorses the broader proposition that landlords are liable under \u00a7 14 when they negligently fail to correct dangerous or disruptive conditions affecting quiet enjoyment.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "We noted that a landlord\u2019s failure \u201cto repair defects of which he has notice in leased premises is an omission which frequently has been deemed to violate \u00a7 14.\u201d See Cruz, supra at 789, citing Simon v. Solomon, supra at 103 (failure to control floods in tenant\u2019s apartment); Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth., 378 Mass. 758, 761 (1979) (failure to repair leaky roof); Dorgan v. Loukas, 19 Mass. App. Ct. 959, 960 (1985) (failure to bring apartment into habitable condition and keep it so). Today we make clear what was implicit in those rulings: to support the imposition of liability under the quiet enjoyment statute, there must be a showing of at least negligent conduct by a landlord\u2026."
