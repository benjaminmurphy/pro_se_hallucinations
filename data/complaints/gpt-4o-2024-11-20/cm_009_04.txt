v.  
**Michael Smith,**  
Defendant  

**Complaint for Modification of Custody Order**

**INTRODUCTION**

The Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, respectfully requests that this Court modify the existing custody and parenting schedule as set forth in the Judgment entered on June 15, 2019, by the Barnstable Probate and Family Court. The Plaintiff alleges that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the original custody order and that modification is necessary to serve the best interests of the minor child, Ava Smith, age 8.

**PARTIES**

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, resides at [Plaintiff’s Address], Massachusetts. She is the mother and custodial parent of the minor child, Ava Smith, born [child’s date of birth].
   
2. The Defendant, Michael Smith, resides at [Defendant’s Address], Cape Cod, Massachusetts. He is the father of the minor child, Ava Smith.

**JURISDICTION & VENUE**

3. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 31, and venue is proper because this matter involves the custody and parenting schedule for a minor child who resides primarily in Barnstable County.

**FACTUAL BACKGROUND**

4. On June 15, 2019, this Court entered a Judgment setting forth a custody arrangement in which the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, was awarded primary physical custody of the minor child, Ava Smith, with the Defendant, Michael Smith, receiving parenting time every other weekend and one midweek overnight on Wednesdays.

5. At the time of the original order, both parties resided in [Original Town, Massachusetts], which ensured that the midweek overnight arrangement would not interfere with the minor child’s schooling or well-being, given the five-minute commute to school the following morning.

6. Since the entry of the original custody arrangement, the Defendant has relocated approximately 90 miles away to Cape Cod, Massachusetts, a distance that significantly impacts the feasibility of the midweek overnight parenting schedule.

7. Notwithstanding the substantial increase in distance, the Defendant continues to exercise his Wednesday overnight parenting time, which requires the minor child to leave school on Wednesday afternoon, travel to Cape Cod, and wake up at approximately 4:30 AM on Thursday mornings to return to school in Barnstable County.

8. The minor child has suffered negative effects due to this unreasonable schedule, including exhaustion, reduced academic participation on Thursdays, and an overall decline in her well-being during the school week.

9. The minor child’s teacher has confirmed that her level of participation on Thursdays has noticeably dropped due to sleep deprivation caused by the midweek overnight parenting arrangement. The necessity of such an arrangement no longer serves the best interests of the child.

**RELEVANT LAW**

10. Under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, § 28, the Court may modify a custody or parenting order upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and a determination that modification is in the best interest of the child.

11. In Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006), the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court reaffirmed that the overriding concern in custody matters is the best interests of the child, which includes examining the practicality and feasibility of parenting schedules.

12. In Hunter v. Rose, 463 Mass. 488 (2012), the Court stated that a parenting arrangement adversely affecting a child’s education and well-being constitutes sufficient grounds for modification.

13. The exhaustion and educational impact faced by the child herein falls squarely within the type of circumstances the Court reviewed in cases such as Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985), and Murphy v. Murphy, 82 Mass. App. Ct. 186 (2012), which emphasize the Court's broad discretion in modifying custody orders to protect the physical and emotional welfare of children.

14. The Massachusetts Probate and Family Court Guidelines for Shared Parenting likewise emphasize that schedules should minimize disruption to a child’s routine and ensure appropriate rest during the school year.

**REQUEST FOR RELIEF**

15. Based on the foregoing, the Plaintiff respectfully submits that the material change in circumstances caused by the Defendant’s relocation and the negative impact of the midweek overnight on the child’s well-being warrant modification of the existing custody order.

16. The Plaintiff, therefore, requests that this Court:

   a. Eliminate the midweek Wednesday overnight parenting time currently exercised by the Defendant during the school year;  
   b. Amend the Defendant’s weekend parenting schedule to accommodate his relocation, with parenting time to begin on Fridays after school and end on Sundays at 6:00 PM;  
   c. Grant any other relief the Court deems just and proper.

**CONCLUSION**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter an Order modifying the custody judgment entered on June 15, 2019, consistent with the requests set forth in paragraph 16 above, and for such other relief as the Court finds just and appropriate under the circumstances.

Respectfully submitted,  

Dated: December 1, 2025
