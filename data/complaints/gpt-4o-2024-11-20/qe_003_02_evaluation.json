The court holds that if drug activity in the common areas renders them unusable, that constitutes a serious interference with quiet enjoyment, and focuses on whether this interference is the natural and probable consequence of the landlord\u2019s acts or omissions.

The court holds that Gem\u2019s omission to fix the porous wall and prevent repeated flooding both breached its duty to maintain habitable, sanitary conditions and constituted interference with the tenant\u2019s quiet enjoyment. That squarely supports using Simon v. Solomon as authority that a landlord\u2019s failure to make necessary repairs can amount to a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.",

The court contrasts this fault-based standard with the strict liability regime of the lead paint statute and clarifies that a statutory violation alone is insufficient to establish a \u00a7 14 breach. Therefore the case is contrary authority to the proposition that landlords are strictly liable under \u00a7 14.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cToday we make clear what was implicit in those rulings: to support the imposition of liability under the quiet enjoyment statute, there must be a showing of at least negligent conduct by a landlord and violation of the lead paint statute alone is not sufficient to prove such negligence. Stated differently, to obtain relief under \u00a7 14 for a claim of lead paint poisoning it must be demonstrated that the landlord had notice of or reason to know of the presence of lead and failed to take appropriate corrective measures.\u201d"

However, it does not use or adopt the specific concepts of an implied warranty of habitability or a broad duty to ensure tenants\u2019 \u2018quiet enjoyment\u2019 of leased premises. Its focus is premises liability and statutory negligence toward visitors, not a general landlord obligation to maintain habitable conditions and quiet enjoyment for tenants as such.",

Although the concurrence would ground the duty specifically in compliance with the State Sanitary Code rather than a broader, undefined warranty, it still clearly endorses the core idea that a landlord must maintain premises in a livable (habitable) condition for tenants.
