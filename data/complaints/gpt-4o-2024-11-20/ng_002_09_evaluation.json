Without the majority opinion text, this excerpt alone cannot be said to support a proposition that the case clarifies causation law.",

The court expressly refuses to impose liability based on foreseeability alone, emphasizing that her conduct did not create a legally cognizable risk for which the common law provides a remedy. Thus, Wallace v. Wilson stands for *no* liability in these circumstances, contrary to the proposition that it supports liability when foreseeability of harm exists.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cWe reject the argument that a parent, who neither provides alcoholic beverages nor makes them available, owes a duty to travelers on the highways to supervise a party given by her minor child. We reach this conclusion even if [the defendant] knew or reasonably should have known that alcoholic beverages would be available. The defendant\u2019s conduct did not create a risk of injury to the plaintiff for which we are prepared to say the common law should provide a remedy\u2026 We continue to adhere to the rule expressed in Langemann, and we think that that rule should apply here.\u201d"
