### **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
5. On or about August 15, 2023, Plaintiff Emily Johnson was lawfully walking along the sidewalk in front of Defendant’s residence, located at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, MA 01201.  
6. A large maple tree, situated on Defendant’s property, had a visibly cracked and drooping branch hanging over the public sidewalk.  
7. Plaintiff had personally observed the hazardous condition of the branch prior to the incident, and neighbors in the area had repeatedly informed Defendant of the branch's cracked state, warning him of the risks it posed.  
8. Despite his awareness, Defendant negligently failed to address the dangerous condition by trimming or removing the branch, which any reasonable homeowner would recognize as posing a foreseeable risk of harm to pedestrians.  
9. Defendant told neighbors he would “deal with it in the spring,” but he did not take any steps to inspect or remedy the dangerous branch.  
10. On August 15, 2023, during a moderate summer thunderstorm with no extraordinary weather conditions, the cracked branch broke and fell directly onto Plaintiff as she was walking on the sidewalk.
11. The fallen branch struck Plaintiff’s shoulder and back, causing her to fall to the ground and sustain injuries.
12. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered physical injuries, including a shoulder strain and multiple significant bruises.  
13. Plaintiff sought and obtained medical treatment for these injuries, incurring medical expenses of approximately $2,500.  
14. Plaintiff was required to miss work from her job in retail for approximately one week due to her injuries, causing her to lose approximately $500 in wages.  
15. Defendant’s failure to remove the visibly hazardous branch or take any steps to ensure the safety of pedestrians constitutes a breach of his duty of care.

### **COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE**  
16. Plaintiff incorporates and re-alleges Paragraphs 1 through 15 as if fully set forth herein.  
17. Under Massachusetts law, Defendant owed Plaintiff, a pedestrian lawfully on the public sidewalk, a duty to maintain his property in a reasonably safe condition and to prevent foreseeable harm caused by dangerous conditions on his property, including hazardous tree branches. *See Graham v. Whitin Mach. Works, Inc.,* 120 Mass. 167 (1876); *Souza v. Southworth, Inc.,* 563 N.E.2d 1359 (Mass. 1990).  
18. Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known that the cracked and drooping tree branch hanging over the sidewalk posed a foreseeable risk of harm to pedestrians. *See Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.,* 457 Mass. 368, 930 N.E.2d 142 (2010).  
19. Defendant’s failure to inspect, remove, or otherwise remedy the visibly defective branch constitutes a breach of his duty of care under Massachusetts law. *See Lais v. Logan Airport Assocs.,* 38 Mass. App. Ct. 854, 857 (1995) (landowners must act reasonably to prevent harm caused by dangerous conditions on their property).  
20. Defendant’s breach of his duty proximately caused Plaintiff’s injuries. But for Defendant’s failure to address the visibly hazardous branch, Plaintiff’s injuries would not have occurred. *See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 302B (1965)* (explaining duty to protect against foreseeable harm).  
21. Defendant’s actions and inactions were unreasonable, negligent, and a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff’s injuries. *See LaClair v. Silberline Mfg. Co., Inc.,* 379 Mass. 21, 406 N.E.2d 1286 (1980).  
22. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered physical pain, emotional distress, medical expenses, and lost wages.
