**David Thompson**  
Defendant  

-----------------------------------------------  
**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**  

**Introduction**  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Martin, in the above-referenced matter, and submits this Complaint for Modification of Custody Order pursuant to M.G.L. c. 208, § 28. As set forth herein, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the existing custody judgment was entered on April 15, 2022, such that modification is necessary to protect the best interests of the minor child, Emily Thompson.  

**Parties**  

1. The Plaintiff, **Jessica Martin**, is an individual residing in Fall River, Massachusetts.  
2. The Defendant, **David Thompson**, is an individual residing in Taunton, Massachusetts.  
3. The Plaintiff and the Defendant are the parents of one minor child, **Emily Thompson**, born on January 10, 2015, who is now 10 years old.  

**Factual Allegations**  

4. The current custody arrangement provides for joint legal custody between the parties, with the Plaintiff as the primary residential parent and the Defendant having substantial parenting time, including Sunday night overnights.  
5. The existing order requires the parties to cooperate on school matters and ensure the child’s attendance at school. When this order was issued, Emily Thompson was excelling academically and had no significant school attendance issues.  
6. Since approximately December 2024, substantial issues have arisen regarding the Defendant’s failure to ensure the child’s regular attendance at school. Specifically:  
   a. The Defendant has repeatedly kept Emily home from school on Mondays following his weekend parenting time, stating that she “needs a mental health day.”  
   b. To date, the Defendant has not provided any documentation or medical justification for the absences.  
   c. As a result of these Monday absences, the Plaintiff and the Defendant received truancy warnings from Emily’s school.  
7. In addition, the Defendant regularly refuses to transport Emily to her scheduled tutoring sessions on weekends. Said refusal has hindered the Plaintiff’s efforts to address Emily’s academic struggles.  
8. Emily’s grades and standardized test scores have dropped notably over the past year. The child, who was formerly an “A” student, now struggles to maintain passing grades in several courses and has expressed anxiety about falling behind in school.  
9. The Plaintiff has made good-faith efforts to resolve these issues with the Defendant, but the Defendant has been uncooperative, dismissive of the school’s concerns, and unwilling to adjust his behavior to comply with the existing custody order.  
10. The Plaintiff asserts that the Defendant’s actions constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances affecting the best interests of Emily, warranting a modification of the current custody arrangement to ensure her educational and emotional needs are met.  

**Applicable Law and Caselaw**  

11. Under M.G.L. c. 208, § 28, modifications to a prior custody judgment may be made when there is a material and substantial change in circumstances and the modification is in the best interests of the child.  
12. The Massachusetts courts have consistently held that the best interests of the child are paramount in determining custody arrangements. See *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).  
13. A parent’s failure to ensure the child’s school attendance and academic well-being justifies modification of custody. See *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012); *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).  
14. Joint legal custody requires "substantial agreement" between the parties on matters affecting the child’s welfare, including education. Where such agreement is lacking, courts have found cause to modify custody. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Wilkins v. Wilkins*, 324 Mass. 261 (1949).  
15. Chronic absenteeism is a legitimate basis for altering an existing custody arrangement. See *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540 (2010).  
16. The Defendant’s actions in this case jeopardize Emily’s educational success and emotional well-being, and granting sole decision-making on educational matters to the Plaintiff or modifying parenting time is necessary to protect the child’s interests. See *Goddard v. Goddard*, 55 Mass. App. Ct. 688 (2002).  

**Request for Relief**  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Modify the current custody judgment to grant the Plaintiff sole legal decision-making authority concerning the child’s educational matters, including school attendance; and/or  
2. Modify the parenting schedule to eliminate Sunday night overnights during the Defendant’s parenting time and ensure the child’s timely attendance at school.  
3. Grant any additional relief that this Court deems just and proper.  

**Verification and Signature**  

I, Jessica Martin, hereby verify under the pains and penalties of perjury that the statements contained in this Complaint for Modification are true and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief.  

Respectfully submitted,
