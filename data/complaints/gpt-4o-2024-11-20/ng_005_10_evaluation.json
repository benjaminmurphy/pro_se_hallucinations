      "support_reasoning": "The opinion discusses duty generally and acknowledges that landowners owe lawful visitors a duty of reasonable care, but its core holding is that this particular defendant *did not* owe the plaintiff a duty to avoid the specific roadway hazard (i.e., to construct a bridge, light, or alter Route 1A). The court expressly rejects expanding a landowner\u2019s duty to cover hazards on adjacent public highways it does not control. Thus, the case limits, rather than supports, the claimed broad duty to avoid creating foreseeable hazards in this context.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "It is well established that an owner or possessor of land owes a common law duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors. \u2026 Although a landowner or possessor typically is not held to any duty with respect to public highways adjacent to or crossing his land, he must exercise reasonable care in the use of his land so as not to injure a traveler on the highway. \u2026 In this case, Westwood did not fail to exercise reasonable care in the use of its land, nor was there any condition on its land that created an unreasonable risk to users of Route 1A."

It does not address, factually or legally, the specific situation of storing an unsecured ladder or the foreseeability of harm from such storage. While Mounsey more generally stands for a duty of reasonable care owed by property owners, nothing in this quoted text establishes or applies that duty to the described ladder scenario, so it does not support the detailed proposition claimed.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"The court holds that the measure of responsibility of an occupier should no longer depend on whether the injured person is characterized as a \u2018licensee\u2019 rather than an \u2018invitee,\u2019 or vice versa; the question is to turn on other, more vital factors. ... The very effort at dry classification and differentation puts the emphasis at the wrong places.\""

      "support_reasoning": "The opinion discusses negligence, duty, breach, and foreseeability, but it does not involve any facts about a ladder, securing a ladder, or a defendant ignoring a plaintiff\u2019s repeated warnings about a specific risk. Instead, it concerns a landowner\u2019s duty to remedy an open and obvious danger created by placing a trampoline next to a shallow pool. Thus, while the case is relevant for the general concept that negligence exists when a duty of reasonable care is breached, it does not specifically support the proposition about failing to secure a ladder after repeated warnings.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201c\u2018Before liability for negligence can be imposed, there must first be a legal duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff, and a breach of that duty proximately resulting in the injury.\u2019 Davis v.

      "support_reasoning": "The opinion in Jupin v.

It expressly leaves breach, proximate cause, and damages to the jury and does not hold that the defendant\u2019s breach was the direct and proximate cause of any specific damage, let alone damage to a vehicle. The cited page thus does not support the proposition that the defendant\u2019s breach was the direct and proximate cause of damage to the plaintiff\u2019s vehicle.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cTo prevail on a negligence claim, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of reasonable care, that the defendant breached this duty, that damage resulted, and that there was a causal relation between the breach of the duty and the damage. \u2026 We generally consider the latter three questions \u2026 to be the special province of the jury.\u201d"

      "support_reasoning": "The opinion in Julian v. Randazzo concerns police use of deadly force, admissibility of a police investigative report, and jury instructions on justification and probable cause. It does not discuss damages, foreseeability, insurance deductibles, rental-car expenses, or any consequential damages analysis. Therefore, it provides no authority for the proposition that a plaintiff\u2019s deductible and rental expenses were foreseeable consequences of a defendant\u2019s failure to secure a ladder.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "In this setting, the judge\u2019s charge properly informed the jury that an officer authorized to make an arrest may use \u201csuch force as is reasonably necessary to effect the arrest,\u201d and that the use of deadly force is subject to the additional limitations stated. It was within the judge\u2019s discretion to decide that the additional elaboration requested by the plaintiff as to what constitutes excessive force might have been confusing rather than helpful."

      "support_reasoning": "The case does not hold that the defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes negligence; it affirms summary judgment for the defendant because plaintiffs failed to prove causation and possibly duty. The opinion explains that there was no evidence linking any act or omission by the defendant to the scaffolding collapse, and thus the negligence claims could not succeed. Therefore, this decision is authority for rejecting negligence liability on these facts, not for establishing that the conduct constitutes negligence under Massachusetts law.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe plaintiffs argue that they presented sufficient evidence to warrant a trial of each of their negligence claims. With respect to each such claim, the plaintiffs bear the burden of proving that the defendant committed a breach of the duty to use reasonable care\u2026 Causation is an essential element of that proof. \u2026 [T]he record reflects that the plaintiffs failed to proffer any evidence explaining why the scaffold collapsed and therefore cannot establish any causal link between their injuries and the defendant\u2019s breach of any duty to them\u2026.\u201d"
