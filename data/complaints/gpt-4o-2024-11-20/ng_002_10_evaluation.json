It does not concern animal injuries, duties to restrain animals, or liability arising from violation of animal-control laws or safety ordinances. Therefore, it provides no authority for the proposition regarding liability for failure to restrain animals.",

Because we conclude that it does not, we also must determine whether one unit owner can enjoy an easement by necessity through another owner's unit for the same purpose. We conclude that an easement by necessity does not arise under these circumstances.\""
