**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**NEWTON DISTRICT COURT**  

**Emily Johnson,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**Mark Thompson,**  
Defendant.  

**COMPLAINT**  

**INTRODUCTION**  
1. This is a civil action to recover damages for personal injuries suffered by the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, due to the negligence of the Defendant, Mark Thompson, at Whiting Park in Newton, Massachusetts, on April 15, 2023.  

**PARTIES**  
2. Plaintiff Emily Johnson is an individual residing in Newton, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  

3. Defendant Mark Thompson is an individual residing in Newton, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19, as the amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of the Newton District Court.  

5. Venue is proper in this Court because the events giving rise to this claim occurred in Newton, Massachusetts, and both the Plaintiff and the Defendant reside in Middlesex County.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
6. Whiting Park in Newton, Massachusetts, is a public park with clearly posted signs requiring all dogs to be restrained on leashes while in the park.  

7. On April 15, 2023, Plaintiff Emily Johnson was jogging on a designated path in Whiting Park when an unleashed dog belonging to Defendant Mark Thompson charged at her while barking aggressively.  

8. At the time of the incident, Defendant was approximately thirty (30) feet away from the dog, engaged in conversation with others, with the dog’s leash in his possession but not secured to the dog.  

9. Fearing for her safety and acting reasonably to avoid what appeared to her to be an imminent attack, Plaintiff swerved off the path and fell down a small embankment, tripping over a tree root.  

10. As a result of the fall, Plaintiff suffered a broken wrist, requiring emergency medical care, a wrist brace, and subsequent medical treatment.  

11. Plaintiff incurred approximately $5,200 in medical expenses and lost approximately $2,000 in wages due to her inability to work during her recovery.  

12. Additionally, Plaintiff was unable to participate in personal activities, including a piano recital for which she had been preparing for months, resulting in emotional distress.  

13. Defendant had actual or constructive knowledge of the signage requiring dogs to be on a leash at Whiting Park and nevertheless allowed his dog to roam freely, creating an unreasonable risk of harm to others, including the Plaintiff.  

14. Defendant failed to exercise reasonable care in controlling his dog, directly and proximately causing Plaintiff’s injuries.  

**NEGLIGENCE CLAIM AGAINST DEFENDANT**  
15. The Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference all prior paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully stated herein.  

16. Under Massachusetts law, individuals have a duty to act with reasonable care to avoid causing foreseeable harm to others. See *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000).  

17. Defendant owed a duty to Plaintiff, as a lawful user of Whiting Park, to comply with park rules, leash laws, and to reasonably control his dog to prevent harm to others.  

18. Defendant breached this duty by failing to leash his dog in compliance with posted park rules, failing to supervise his dog, and failing to take reasonable precautions to prevent his dog from startling or endangering park users.  

19. Defendant’s negligent actions and omissions were a proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries. See *Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637, 639 (1996).  

20. Though the dog did not make physical contact with Plaintiff, Defendant’s negligence directly caused Plaintiff to swerve and fall while trying to avoid what she reasonably perceived as an imminent risk of being attacked. See *Adams v. Dunhill*, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 215, 217 (2005) (negligence liability may arise where foreseeable consequences of one's actions result in injury to the plaintiff).  

21. Plaintiff’s injuries were a foreseeable consequence of Defendant’s unreasonable failure to control his dog. See *Irwin v. Town of Ware*, 392 Mass. 745, 756 (1984) (foreseeability is integral to establishing negligence).  

22. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained physical injuries, incurred medical expenses, suffered lost income, and experienced emotional distress.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Johnson requests that this Honorable Court grant the following relief:  
A. Compensatory damages in the amount of $7,200, representing $5,200 in medical expenses and $2,000 in lost wages, or in such other amount as the Court may determine;  
B. Damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress in an amount to be determined at trial;  
C. Pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law under G.L. c. 231, § 6B;  
D. Costs of this action, including reasonable attorney’s fees if applicable; and  
E. Such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.  

**JURY DEMAND**  
Pursuant to Rule 38(b) of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.

**DATED:** December 1, 2025  

Respectfully Submitted,
