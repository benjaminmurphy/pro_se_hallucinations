_______________________________  

**COMPLAINT**  

**INTRODUCTION**  

1. Plaintiff Jessica Brown (“Plaintiff”) brings this action against Defendant Mark Thompson (“Defendant”), seeking damages and equitable relief arising from Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law, as codified in G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

2. Defendant’s failure to maintain secure premises, despite repeated notice, has caused significant interference with Plaintiff's quiet enjoyment of her tenancy and created unsafe living conditions.

**PARTIES**  

3. Plaintiff Jessica Brown is a resident of Chelsea, Massachusetts, and resides at 123 Main Street, Apartment 3, Chelsea, MA 02150. She has lived at this address since June 1, 2022.  

4. Defendant Mark Thompson is the owner and landlord of 123 Main Street, Chelsea, MA 02150. Upon information and belief, Defendant resides in Suffolk County, Massachusetts, and is the person responsible for maintaining the property rented to Plaintiff.

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

5. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 2, as the damages sought exceed the threshold amount for claims within the jurisdiction of the District Court.  

6. Venue is proper under G.L. c. 223, § 1, as the property at issue is located in Chelsea, Suffolk County, Massachusetts, and the actions giving rise to this complaint occurred within this judicial district.

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

7. Plaintiff has been a tenant of Defendant at the property located at 123 Main Street, Chelsea, MA 02150, since June 1, 2022, paying $1,500.00 in monthly rent.  

8. Under Massachusetts law, Defendant has a legal obligation to maintain the premises in a condition fit for habitation and to ensure Plaintiff’s peaceful enjoyment of her tenancy, pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

9. The main entry door to the property does not lock or latch properly, meaning that anyone can push the door open and gain access to the building.  

10. Plaintiff gave Defendant initial notice of the defective lock approximately two months ago, notifying him that the broken lock created a safety risk to tenants.  

11. Defendant acknowledged the issue and promised to repair the lock, yet no repairs were made over the ensuing two months.  

12. Plaintiff repeatedly followed up with Defendant, reporting the continued security concerns, but Defendant failed to take any corrective action.  

13. As a result of Defendant’s inaction, unauthorized persons were able to enter the building. In November 2025, Plaintiff discovered that packages left in the common hallway were stolen by an unknown individual. Plaintiff lost a package worth approximately $120.00 as part of this incident.  

14. Plaintiff also noticed signs indicating that someone was trespassing in the basement of the building, such as discarded sleeping materials, which caused Plaintiff considerable anxiety and concern for her safety.  

15. Plaintiff was forced to install a security camera at her apartment door and replace her door’s deadbolt lock with a more secure one, incurring out-of-pocket expenses totaling $200.00.  

16. Defendant has dismissed Plaintiff’s concerns, telling her that she is “overreacting” and claiming that the neighborhood is “safe.”  

17. As a proximate result of Defendant’s inaction, Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment of the premises has been substantially infringed upon, and Plaintiff has been forced to endure both financial damages and emotional distress.

18. Defendant’s conduct as described above constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

**CAUSE OF ACTION — BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**  

19. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations in Paragraphs 1 through 18 above as if fully set forth herein.  

20. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, every Massachusetts landlord is obligated to ensure tenants’ quiet enjoyment of their rental premises and to avoid any acts or omissions that substantially interfere with their tenants’ use and enjoyment of the property.  

21. By allowing the main entry door to remain unsecured, despite repeated notice of the defective lock and its potential for harm, Defendant has caused significant interference with Plaintiff’s ability to safely use and enjoy her rental premises.  

22. Massachusetts courts have long recognized a landlord’s duty to maintain the security and habitability of multi-tenant buildings. See, e.g., *Dartt v. Browning-Ferris Indus., Inc.*, 427 Mass. 1, 9 (1998); *King v. G & M Realty Corp.*, 373 Mass. 658, 661 (1977).  

23. Defendant’s failure to repair the lock or otherwise address the security concerns constitutes a violation of Massachusetts law governing quiet enjoyment. See, e.g., *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273, 285 (1994).  

24. Defendant’s inaction in the face of known security defects created unsafe conditions that directly caused the theft of Plaintiff’s property and placed Plaintiff in fear for her safety. See *Miller v. Shanahan*, 386 Mass. 302, 305 (1982).  

25. Defendant’s conduct is egregious in light of his continued refusal to address these security concerns, despite repeated notice from Plaintiff. See *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196, 201 (1979).  

26. Plaintiff has suffered financial loss, emotional distress, and a loss of enjoyment of her tenancy as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 92-93 (1982) (describing the damages available for breach of quiet enjoyment).

A. An award of monetary damages in the amount of $320.00, representing the losses Plaintiff incurred as a result of Defendant’s breach, including the theft of Plaintiff’s package and the cost of securing her own premises;  

B. An award of emotional distress damages, in an amount to be determined at trial, for the distress and anxiety caused by Defendant’s failure to maintain secure and habitable premises;  

C. Statutory damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14, which provides for minimum damages of three months’ rent for breaches of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;  

D. An order requiring Defendant to immediately repair the defective lock on the building’s main entry door;  

E. Attorneys’ fees and costs, pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14; and
