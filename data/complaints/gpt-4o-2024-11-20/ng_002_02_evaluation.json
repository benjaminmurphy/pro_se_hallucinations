That formulation reflects the general Massachusetts negligence principle that liability arises when a party breaches a duty of care and thereby causes injury. Although the case is in the specific context of negligent infliction of emotional distress, it clearly affirms the breach-of-duty-plus-injury structure of negligence under Massachusetts law.",

However, the court explicitly declines to decide whether the defendant in fact owed a duty of care to these plaintiffs as landowner/general contractor, and instead affirms summary judgment solely on lack of causation. Thus, the case supports the general negligence proposition (duty to act reasonably to prevent harm) but not the specific application that this defendant owed this plaintiff such a duty at all relevant times.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "With respect to each such claim, the plaintiffs bear the burden of proving that the defendant committed a breach of the duty to use reasonable care, that the plaintiffs suffered actual loss, and that the defendant\u2019s negligence caused their loss. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 281 (1965). ... Because the plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden on the issue of causation, we need not decide whether they presented sufficient evidence to show that the defendant owed a duty of care to them sufficient to survive the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment."

It does not address, even by analogy, foreseeability of harm from an unleashed dog in a public park or the foreseeability of evasive action by a plaintiff.
