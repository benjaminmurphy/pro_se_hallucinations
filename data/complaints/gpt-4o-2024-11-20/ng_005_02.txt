### COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
### HAMPDEN COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT  

**Jessica Turner,**  
*Plaintiff*,  

v.  

**Michael Adams,**  
*Defendant.*  
 
Civil Action No. __________  

### COMPLAINT  

**PARTIES**  

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Turner, is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, MA.  
2. The Defendant, Michael Adams, is an individual who resides at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, MA.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1, as both Plaintiff and Defendant reside in Massachusetts and the events giving rise to this Complaint occurred within the Commonwealth.  
4. Venue is proper in Hampden County pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1, as the incident occurred at 123 Maple Street in Springfield, MA, which lies within Hampden County.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

5. Plaintiff Jessica Turner and Defendant Michael Adams reside in a shared duplex located at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, MA, and share a common driveway on the property.  
6. Defendant Michael Adams stored a tall aluminum extension ladder leaning unsecured against a wooden fence located adjacent to the shared driveway.  
7. Plaintiff had previously informed Defendant on multiple occasions that the unsecured ladder posed a hazard and was at risk of falling, particularly on windy days.  
8. On or about March 15, 2023, during strong wind conditions, the ladder became dislodged and fell onto Plaintiff's vehicle while Plaintiff was backing into the shared driveway.  
9. The falling ladder struck the hood and windshield of Plaintiff's vehicle, causing substantial damage, including a dented hood and cracked windshield.  
10. As a result of the damage caused by Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff’s vehicle required bodywork and windshield replacement, forcing Plaintiff to incur out-of-pocket expenses, including but not limited to her insurance deductible and car rental fees while the repairs were performed.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION: NEGLIGENCE**  

11. Plaintiff reasserts and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 10 of this Complaint as if fully stated herein.  
12. Defendant had a duty to act with reasonable care to ensure that the tall aluminum extension ladder stored on his property did not pose a foreseeable risk of harm to Plaintiff or her property. See *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973) (establishing a general duty of reasonable care owed to all lawful visitors).  
13. Defendant breached this duty by failing to secure the ladder properly, despite knowing that it was unsecured and posed a foreseeable risk of falling under windy conditions. See *Poskus v. Lombardo's of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637, 639 (1996) (a property owner owes a duty to take reasonable steps to prevent harm from foreseeable dangers).  
14. Defendant’s breach of this duty was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s property damage. See *Jesionek v. Massachusetts Port Authority*, 376 Mass. 101, 105 (1978) (a landowner’s breach of a duty of reasonable care is actionable where the breach causes harm to a lawful visitor).  
15. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff sustained damages, including the costs of repairing damage to her vehicle and renting a car in the interim. See *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000) (damages are recoverable where harm is reasonably foreseeable).  
16. Defendant’s failure to take even minimal precautions, such as tying down or moving the ladder to a safer location after being warned of its instability, constitutes negligent conduct. See *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368, 378 (2010) (failure to address known hazards can constitute negligence).  
17. Defendant’s conduct fell below the standard of care owed and resulted in damage that was reasonably foreseeable under the circumstances. See *Glick v. Prince Italian Foods of Saugus, Inc.*, 25 Mass. App. Ct. 901, 902 (1987) (property owners must take reasonable care to remedy known hazards).  

**DAMAGES**  

18. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff incurred significant costs, including but not limited to:  
    a. The cost of repairing the dented hood and cracked windshield of her vehicle;  
    b. Out-of-pocket expenses for her insurance deductible; and  
    c. Car rental fees incurred while Plaintiff’s vehicle was undergoing repair.  
19. Plaintiff’s damages were directly and proximately caused by Defendant’s negligent failure to secure the ladder. See *Ayala v. Boston Hous. Auth.*, 404 Mass. 689, 699 (1989) (damages recoverable where caused by defendant’s lack of reasonable care).  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Turner respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grant the following relief:  

a. Judgment in favor of the Plaintiff and against Defendant for all damages sustained as a result of Defendant’s negligence;  
b. An award of damages to Plaintiff in an amount sufficient to reimburse all out-of-pocket costs incurred as a result of the property damage, including but not limited to the cost of vehicle repair, her insurance deductible, and car rental fees, plus any other compensatory damages allowed by law;  
c. An award of costs, interest, and reasonable attorney’s fees as permitted by law; and  
d. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and necessary.  

Respectfully submitted,  
Dated: December 1, 2025
