**LINDSAY CARTER,**  
   Plaintiff,  
   v.  
**JASON REYNOLDS,**  
   Defendant.  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Lindsay Carter, and respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the existing custody judgment entered on April 15, 2022, regarding the minor child, Emily Carter, born September 10, 2015. In support of this Complaint, Plaintiff states as follows:  

---

## **PARTIES**

1. Plaintiff, Lindsay Carter (“Plaintiff”), resides in Lexington, Massachusetts, and is the primary residential parent of the minor child Emily Carter.  
2. Defendant, Jason Reynolds (“Defendant”), resides in Waltham, Massachusetts, and exercises substantial parenting time, including overnights on Sundays.  

---

## **JURISDICTION**

3. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, as the initial custody judgment was issued by this Court, and Massachusetts is the home state of the child under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, G.L. c. 209B.

---

## **FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY**

4. The current judgment providing for shared legal custody was issued by this Court on April 15, 2022.  
5. Plaintiff was designated the primary residential parent. Defendant was granted substantial weekend parenting time, including overnights on Sunday. The judgment requires the parties to cooperate regarding the child’s education and best interests.  
6. At the time the custody judgment was entered, the minor child, Emily, age 10, was performing satisfactorily in school, with stable grades and regular attendance.  
7. Over the past year, Defendant has habitually kept Emily home from school on the Monday following his parenting time. Defendant’s stated justification for these absences is that Emily requires a “mental health day.” However, no medical documentation supports this claim, and no mutual decision-making or consultation with Plaintiff has occurred.  
8. As a result, Emily’s school has issued truancy warnings to Plaintiff, and Emily’s academic progress has suffered. Her grades have declined significantly, and her most recent standardized test scores reflect a material setback in her education.  
9. Defendant has also failed to ensure Emily’s attendance at tutoring sessions scheduled during his parenting time, despite Emily’s demonstrated need for academic assistance.  
10. Plaintiff has attempted to communicate with Defendant about these issues and proposed solutions to safeguard Emily’s education. Defendant has refused to cooperate.

## **MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**

11. Plaintiff contends that since the entry of the April 15, 2022, judgment, there has been a material change in circumstances that warrants a modification of the current custody arrangement.  
12. Specifically:  
    a. Emily’s academic performance has diminished due to excessive absences from school during Defendant’s parenting time.  
    b. Defendant’s unilateral decisions to withhold Emily from school undermine her educational progress and violate the shared legal custody arrangement requiring cooperative parenting.  
    c. Defendant’s refusal to ensure Emily attends tutoring further jeopardizes her ability to succeed academically.

## **LEGAL STANDARD AND APPLICABLE LAW**

13. Modification of custody orders is governed by G.L. c. 208, § 28, which allows for modification when a material change in circumstances has occurred, and the modification is in the best interests of the child.  
14. Massachusetts courts require that the primary consideration in custody modifications is the best interests of the child. _See Ardizoni v. Raymond_, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734, 736 (1996); _Custody of Kali_, 439 Mass. 834, 845 (2003).  
15. A court may modify custody specifically where issues of schooling, attendance, and academic welfare arise as material changes. _See Care and Protection of Georgette_, 54 Mass. App. Ct. 778, 785 (2002); _Brogna v. Brogna_, 102 Mass. App. Ct. 1101 (2023) (Rule 1:28 decision).  
16. Courts have found that failure to cooperate in shared legal custody arrangements undermines the child’s best interests. _See Hunter v. Rose_, 463 Mass. 488, 497 (2012); _Rolde v. Rolde_, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 405 (1981).  
17. School attendance and academic progress are recognized as key components of a child's best interests. _See K.J. v. M.A.,_ 100 Mass. App. Ct. 216, 222 (2021); _Custody of Vaughn_, 422 Mass. 590, 597 (1996).  
18. Defendant’s unilateral withholding of critical educational opportunities violates the principles of cooperative parenting. _See Felton v. Felton_, 383 Mass. 232, 233 (1981); _R.H. v. B.F._, 102 Mass. App. Ct. 1107 (2023) (Rule 1:28 decision).  
19. A parenting plan that impairs a child’s education constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances justifying modification. _See Katzman v. Healy_, 77 Mass. App. Ct. 589, 597-598 (2010).

## **RELIEF REQUESTED**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Enter an order modifying the existing judgment by granting Plaintiff sole legal custody with respect to the minor child’s education. Alternatively, Plaintiff requests that the Court order that Plaintiff have primary decision-making authority on school attendance and academic matters.  
2. Modify the parenting schedule to require that Defendant’s parenting time end at 6:00 p.m. on Sundays to ensure adequate preparation and attendance at school on Monday mornings.  
3. Order such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper in the circumstances.  

Respectfully submitted,  
Plaintiff,
