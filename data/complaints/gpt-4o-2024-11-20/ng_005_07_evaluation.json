It does not address ladders, shared parking areas, wind, or any specific duty to secure stored objects, nor does it discuss foreseeability in that concrete context. Thus, this citation does not provide direct authority for the particularized proposition about a duty to secure a ladder in a windy environment.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"The court holds that the measure of responsibility of an occupier should no longer depend on whether the injured person is characterized as a \u2018licensee\u2019 rather than an \u2018invitee,\u2019 or vice versa; the question is to turn on other, more vital factors. But footnote 7 seems to say that \u2018trespassers\u2019 stand apart, that that characterization is to remain decisive or highly influential. This tends to perpetuate, although on a smaller scale, the kind of tradition-bound and mistaken analysis that I had supposed the court was aiming to correct.\""

Cormier v. Lynn is about sovereign immunity under the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, focusing on whether public defendants \u2018originally caused\u2019 a situation under \u00a7 10(j), not on general foreseeability of harm from physical conditions like a ladder in the wind. The opinion does not discuss ladders, wind, or apply a foreseeability analysis analogous to the proposition, so it does not support that specific statement.",

Rather, the issue on appeal is whether, under the act, the public defendants may be held liable for that negligence. We conclude that the act protects them from liability for such negligence.\""
