---

### **PARTIES AND JURISDICTION**

1. Plaintiff James Miller is an individual residing in Plymouth County, Massachusetts, and is the father and legal guardian of D.M., a minor child born on January 9, 2017.  
2. Defendant Brockton Community Center, Inc. is a Massachusetts nonprofit corporation with its principal place of business located at 1234 Main St, Brockton, Massachusetts 02301.

### **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

4. Plaintiff enrolled his son, D.M., in an after-school program operated by Defendant at its community center located in Brockton, Massachusetts.  
5. Defendant advertised and represented that children attending the after-school program would be supervised at all times while participating in its activities, including during gym time.  
6. On or about September 15, 2023, during a scheduled gym period, D.M. was playing in Defendant’s gymnasium under the supposed supervision of Defendant’s staff.  
7. At that time, there were twenty children in the gymnasium, supervised by one staff member present on the gym floor. Another staff member who was scheduled to supervise the children was absent, reportedly completing paperwork in an office.  
8. Despite the large number of children and the staff member's duty to supervise them, the individual in charge was inattentive, sitting near the bleachers and reportedly preoccupied with her phone.  
9. During this time, two older boys, approximately twelve years old, began engaging in a rough tackle game on the hardwood floor.  
10. Several other children informed the staff member of the roughhousing, but the staff member dismissed their concerns, stating, "boys will be boys."  
11. Due to the staff member's failure to intervene, the roughhousing continued, resulting in one of the older boys tackling D.M., then aged eight and visibly smaller in stature.  
12. D.M. was knocked to the floor, hitting his head on the hardwood surface and losing consciousness for approximately thirty (30) seconds.  
13. Plaintiff was called to the scene where D.M. appeared disoriented and was subsequently taken to the emergency room for medical evaluation.  
14. As a result of this incident, D.M. was diagnosed with a concussion that caused him to miss several days of school and required additional medical follow-ups and treatment.

### **CAUSE OF ACTION: NEGLIGENCE**

15. Plaintiff incorporates all preceding paragraphs as if fully stated herein.  
16. Defendant owed a duty of care to Plaintiff and D.M. to ensure the safety and well-being of children enrolled in its programs and to provide proper and adequate supervision during activities, including gymnasium time. See *Cormier v. Lynn, 479 Mass. 35, 37 (2018).*  
17. Defendant breached its duty of care by:  
   a. Failing to adequately supervise the children in the gymnasium despite knowing that children require consistent adult monitoring to ensure their safety;  
   b. Allowing one staff member to leave the gym unsupervised;  
   c. Failing to act when informed of hazardous behavior, such as roughhousing, by other children; and  
   d. Failing to implement or enforce adequate safety policies to prevent risky behavior among unsupervised children.  

18. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, D.M. suffered serious injuries, including, but not limited to, physical pain, emotional distress, a concussion, and educational disruption. See *Leavitt v. Brockton Hosp., Inc., 454 Mass. 37, 39-40 (2009).*  
19. Plaintiff has incurred significant medical expenses totaling approximately $5,000 and lost wages amounting to $1,200 to care for his injured son, D.M. See *Glannon v. Boston Elev. Ry., 224 Mass. 427, 430 (1916).*  
20. Defendant’s actions and omissions constitute negligence under Massachusetts law. See *G.L. c. 231, § 85* and *Afarian v. Mass. Elec. Co., 449 Mass. 257, 271 (2007).*
