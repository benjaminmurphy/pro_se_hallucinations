v.  

**Mark Thompson**  
Defendant.  

### COMPLAINT  

**Introduction**  
1. Plaintiff, Jessica Torres, brings this action against Defendant, Mark Thompson, for breach of the statutory and common-law covenant of quiet enjoyment pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, arising from Defendant's failure to provide essential services, namely hot water, at Plaintiff’s rental unit located at 123 Maple Street, Brockton, Massachusetts.  

**Parties**  
2. Plaintiff, Jessica Torres, is an individual who resides at 123 Maple Street, Apartment 2, Brockton, Massachusetts 02301.  
3. Defendant, Mark Thompson, is the owner and landlord of the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Brockton, Massachusetts 02301, and conducts business as a landlord within Plymouth County.  

**Jurisdiction and Venue**  
4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to M.G.L. c. 218, § 19.  
5. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to M.G.L. c. 223, § 1, as the events giving rise to this cause of action occurred in Brockton, Massachusetts, within the jurisdiction of this Court.  

**Factual Allegations**  
6. Plaintiff entered into a valid rental agreement with Defendant on or about January 1, 2022, for the property located at 123 Maple Street, Brockton, Massachusetts, with monthly rent set at $1200.  
7. Since on or about November 10, 2025, Plaintiff’s apartment has been without hot water, an essential utility required for habitability and reasonable use of the premises.  
8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the lack of hot water on November 10, 2025. Defendant acknowledged the issue and stated that a necessary repair part was ordered but backordered.  
9. Despite repeated follow-ups by Plaintiff, including text messages, Defendant has failed to remedy the issue as of the date of this filing, December 1, 2025, leaving Plaintiff without hot water for over three weeks.  
10. Due to the lack of hot water, Plaintiff has been forced to incur additional expenses, including a $30 monthly gym membership to access shower facilities, transportation costs associated with traveling to the gym, and reliance on third parties to provide bathing facilities for her infant child.  
11. Plaintiff has suffered significant inconvenience, loss of comfort, and emotional distress as a result of Defendant’s failure to address the lack of hot water in a timely manner.

**Claim for Relief**  
**Count One: Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (M.G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  
12. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations in Paragraphs 1 through 11 as though fully set forth herein.  
13. Under Massachusetts law, landlords are required to uphold the covenant of quiet enjoyment, a statutory and common-law right, ensuring tenants have the right to the full, uninterrupted use and enjoyment of their rented premises.  
14. M.G.L. c. 186, § 14 prohibits landlords from interfering with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the rented premises, including through the failure to repair or provide essential services such as hot water.  
15. The chronic and unreasonable deprivation of hot water in Plaintiff’s apartment for over three weeks constitutes a breach of this covenant.  
16. Defendant’s failure to provide hot water has made the premises less habitable, created a significant inconvenience, and interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to enjoy the premises without disruption.  
17. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages, including financial costs and emotional distress.  

**Damages and Prayer for Relief**  
18. Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus attorney fees and costs.  
19. Plaintiff seeks damages in the amount of $450 for the additional expenses incurred as a result of Defendant’s breach.  
20. Plaintiff also seeks the statutory minimum damages of three months’ rent ($3600), as required under Massachusetts law in cases involving breaches of quiet enjoyment.  
21. Plaintiff is entitled to reasonable attorney fees and costs pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, although Plaintiff has had to proceed without legal representation due to financial constraints.  

**Wherefore, Plaintiff requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief**:  
A. Damages in the amount of $450 for incidental expenses incurred by Plaintiff;  
B. Statutory damages of three months’ rent ($3600) pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186, § 14;  
C. Costs of this lawsuit, including any filing fees and reasonable attorney fees; and  
D. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and appropriate.  

**Jury Trial Demand**  
Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
