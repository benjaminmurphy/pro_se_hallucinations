Unless one is to apply a fixed but arbitrary rule, the issue can be resolved only on a case by case basis. The effect on the child of any removal is most important. An evaluation of the best interests of the child requires attention to whether the quality of the child\u2019s life may be improved by the change (including any improvement flowing from an improvement in the quality of the custodial parent\u2019s life), the possible adverse effect of the elimination or curtailment of the child\u2019s association with the noncustodial parent, and the extent to which moving or not moving will affect the emotional, physical, or developmental needs of the child.\u201d"

It does not discuss the substantive duties of joint legal custody, joint physical custody, or a generalized duty of parental cooperation under Massachusetts law. Any references to the mother\u2019s lack of cooperation (e.g., not informing the father of certain matters) are fact-specific and related to removal and contempt, not an articulation of general \u2018duties of joint custody and parental cooperation,\u2019 so this case does not provide doctrinal support for that proposition.",

While the case is not framed as a classic \"modification\" of an existing custody judgment, the Court affirms a custody allocation that explicitly weighs how changed living arrangements and parental conduct affect the child\u2019s welfare. Thus it is reasonably supportive of the broader proposition that custody changes are appropriate when circumstances affecting the child\u2019s welfare change, though it is not a paradigmatic modification case like Rolde.",

The opinion discusses the best-interests standard and the judge\u2019s discretion in making an initial custody award and visitation order, but it does not address modification of an existing custody judgment based on a material change in circumstances.
