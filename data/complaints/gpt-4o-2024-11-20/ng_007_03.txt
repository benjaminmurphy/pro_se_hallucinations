**Plaintiff,**  

v.  

**BROCKTON COMMUNITY CENTER,**  

**Defendant.**

**CIVIL ACTION NO._______________**  
**COMPLAINT**  

**I. INTRODUCTION**  

1. This is a civil action seeking damages for personal injury based on the negligence of the Defendant, Brockton Community Center, which failed to adequately supervise children under its care, directly resulting in injuries to Plaintiff’s minor child, J.T.  

2. This action arises under the negligence law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including but not limited to the principles established in **G.L. c. 231, § 85**, and relevant case law recognizing the duty of care owed by childcare providers to protect children from foreseeable harm.  

**II. PARTIES**  

3. Plaintiff, Lucas Thompson, is a resident of Brockton, Plymouth County, Massachusetts, and the father and legal guardian of J.T., an eight-year-old minor injured due to Defendant's negligence.  

4. Defendant, Brockton Community Center, is a nonprofit organization with a principal place of business at 45 East Main Street, Brockton, Plymouth County, Massachusetts.  

**III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

5. Jurisdiction is proper because the incident occurred in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the Defendant operates its facility in Brockton, Plymouth County.  

6. Venue is proper under **G.L. c. 223, § 1** as the events giving rise to this claim occurred at Defendant’s community center in Brockton, Massachusetts.  

**IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

7. On or about September 15, 2023, J.T., an eight-year-old minor, was enrolled in an after-school program held at Defendant’s community center.  

8. Defendant advertises and represents that children who attend its programs will be properly supervised at all times and that its staff are adequately trained to ensure the safety of participants.  

9. On the date in question, approximately 20 children, including J.T., were in the gymnasium under the care of two staff members. However, one staff member left the gym to handle paperwork, leaving only one staff member to supervise.  

10. The remaining staff member failed to adequately monitor the children, instead sitting near the bleachers and spending time looking at her phone.  

11. During this period of inadequate supervision, two larger boys—approximately 12 years old—began roughhousing and playing a tackle game on the hardwood floor.  

12. Several children, including J.T., alerted the staff member to the dangerous conduct, but the staff member dismissed their concerns, responding, “boys will be boys.”  

13. J.T., a smaller eight-year-old, was tackled to the ground by one of the larger boys during the roughhousing. He struck his head on the hardwood floor and lost consciousness for approximately 30 seconds.  

14. J.T. was rushed to the hospital, where he was treated for a concussion. His injuries required time off from school, ongoing medical care, and resulted in substantial medical expenses.  

15. Defendant had a duty to exercise reasonable care to protect children in its care from foreseeable hazards, including injuries caused by rough or reckless play under inadequate supervision.  

16. Defendant breached its duty of care by failing to maintain adequate supervision, failing to intervene to prevent foreseeable harm, and failing to ensure there were enough staff members properly monitoring the children.  

17. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, J.T. suffered physical injuries, pain and suffering, emotional distress, and economic harm, including medical expenses incurred and lost wages suffered by his father.  

**V. CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**NEGLIGENCE**  

18. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  

19. Defendant owed a duty of care to J.T. as an entrusted attendee of its after-school program.  

20. The duty of care owed by Defendant required providing adequate supervision and addressing foreseeable dangers arising from the conduct of children under its care.  

21. Defendant breached its duty of care by, among other things:  
    a. Failing to properly supervise children in its program;  
    b. Leaving only one staff member to supervise a group of approximately 20 children, in violation of industry standards;  
    c. Allowing staff to be inattentive to the children’s activities; and  
    d. Ignoring warnings and complaints of unsafe conduct from other children.  

22. Defendant knew or should have known that inadequate supervision and dismissing unsafe conduct would likely result in harm to children, including J.T.  

23. Defendant’s breach of duty was the direct and proximate cause of J.T.’s injuries and the damages suffered by Plaintiff.  

24. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has incurred economic damages, including $5,200 in medical expenses and $1,500 in lost wages, as well as non-economic damages, including pain and suffering, and emotional distress.  

**VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Lucas Thompson, as parent and next friend of J.T., respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant on all counts;  
2. Award Plaintiff damages in an amount to be determined at trial but sufficient to compensate for all economic and non-economic damages, including but not limited to $5,200 in medical expenses, $1,500 in lost wages, and additional damages for the pain, suffering, and emotional distress suffered by J.T.;  
3. Award Plaintiff interest, costs, and reasonable attorney’s fees, as permitted by law; and  
4. Grant all other relief this Court deems just and proper.  

**VII. DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL**  

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,  

Dated: December 1, 2025
