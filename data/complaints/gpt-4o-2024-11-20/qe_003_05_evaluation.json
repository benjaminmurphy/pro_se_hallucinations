It then applies that standard to conclude that inability to use common areas due to criminal activity would constitute a serious interference with tenants\u2019 use and enjoyment of their homes. This aligns closely with the proposition that every tenant is entitled to a covenant of quiet enjoyment guaranteeing freedom from serious interference with use and enjoyment of rental property.",
