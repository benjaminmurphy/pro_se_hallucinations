The court explains that in joint physical custody situations, \u201ccause shown\u201d means a showing that removal is in the \u201cbest interests\u201d of the children, and then reviews the judge\u2019s decision solely through that lens, confirming that the children\u2019s best interests are the controlling consideration.
