**INTRODUCTION**  

1. This is a civil action brought by Plaintiff Jessica Tran against her landlord, Defendant Linda Harrison, for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law (Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14).  

2. Despite Defendant’s obligation to maintain the rental property in a habitable condition, Defendant has failed to address severe environmental conditions that have resulted in the ongoing presence of mold in Plaintiff’s apartment, causing her physical harm and depriving her of the use and enjoyment of her rental property.  

---

### **PARTIES**  

3. Plaintiff Jessica Tran is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01851 (“the Premises”).  

4. Defendant Linda Harrison is an individual and the owner of the Premises, with a mailing address of [Defendant's address, if known].

### **JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

5. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 218, § 19, as the amount in controversy does not exceed $25,000.  

6. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223, § 1, because the Premises at issue is located in Lowell, Massachusetts, within this Court’s jurisdiction.

### **FACTS**  

7. On June 1, 2020, Plaintiff Jessica Tran entered into a lease agreement with Defendant Linda Harrison to rent the Premises at a monthly rate of $1,200.  

8. The Premises includes a bathroom that lacks a window and relies solely on an exhaust fan for ventilation.  

9. In or around October 2025, Plaintiff noticed mold growth in the corner of her bathroom shower. Over time, the mold spread to the bathroom ceiling.  

10. Plaintiff promptly informed Defendant of the issue. Defendant inspected the bathroom but refused to take adequate corrective action, instead blaming Plaintiff for the mold growth.  

11. Despite Plaintiff’s reasonable maintenance of the Premises, including regular use of the bathroom exhaust fan, Defendant unjustifiably accused Plaintiff of causing the mold issue by allegedly taking "too hot and too long" showers.  

12. Defendant has refused to repair or replace the bathroom ventilation system, which is inadequate, contributing to excessive moisture and the resulting mold growth.  

13. The existing mold has caused Plaintiff to experience persistent respiratory problems, including coughing, congestion, and wheezing. A medical professional has advised Plaintiff that these health issues are linked to the mold exposure.  

14. Plaintiff has incurred additional expenses, including $60 to replace mold-damaged personal property and medical costs for treating her respiratory symptoms.  

15. Defendant’s failure to address the mold and provide a habitable living environment constitutes a violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law.

### **CAUSES OF ACTION**  

#### **COUNT I: Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  

16. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 15.  

17. Massachusetts law provides that tenants of residential properties are entitled to the covenant of quiet enjoyment, codified in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14.  

18. Defendant’s failure to address the ongoing mold problem has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy the Premises.  

19. The presence of mold in the bathroom has directly impacted the habitability of the apartment, created a health hazard, and caused Plaintiff to suffer physical harm and property damage.  

20. Defendant’s actions and omissions constitute a violation of Plaintiff’s statutory and common law rights to quiet enjoyment.  

21. Defendant’s conduct, in refusing to adequately address the habitability issues and blaming Plaintiff for the mold growth, was willful, egregious, and in bad faith, warranting damages as set forth in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14.  

22. Plaintiff has been damaged as a result of Defendant’s breach, including:  
    a. Medical costs related to respiratory symptoms caused by mold exposure;  
    b. $60 incurred for damaged personal property;  
    c. Emotional distress and loss of use and enjoyment of the Premises; and  
    d. Statutory damages provided under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14.
