**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

6. Plaintiff is a tenant who has resided in Unit 3 of the building located at 123 Maple Street, Lynn, MA, at all relevant times.  

7. Defendant, as the owner and landlord of the property, is responsible for ensuring the safe maintenance of the common areas of the property, including smoke detection systems, per Massachusetts law.  

8. A smoke detector located in the common hallway outside Plaintiff’s unit had been chirping due to a low battery for months before September 15, 2023.  

9. On multiple occasions, Plaintiff notified Defendant of the defective smoke detector and requested that it be repaired.  

10. Defendant repeatedly assured Plaintiff that it would repair the smoke detector but failed to take any action.  

11. At some point, the smoke detector’s battery was completely removed, leaving no functioning smoke detector in the hallway outside Plaintiff's unit.  

12. On September 15, 2023, a fire broke out in a first-floor apartment at 123 Maple Street due to a kitchen incident, producing thick, noxious smoke that quickly spread to the upper floors.  

13. Because the smoke detector in the hallway had been disabled, Plaintiff and other tenants on the third floor received no warning of the fire.  

14. Plaintiff became aware of the fire only when she smelled smoke, at which point the hallway was already filled with heavy smoke.  

15. Plaintiff attempted to evacuate the building but experienced significant difficulty breathing due to the smoke.  

16. Plaintiff was transported to the hospital and treated for smoke inhalation, which required overnight observation and medical care.  

17. Plaintiff has incurred approximately $10,500 in medical expenses and suffered lost wages of approximately $2,000 as a result of her injuries.  

18. Plaintiff's personal property in her apartment was also damaged by smoke and water during the incident, causing additional financial harm.  

19. Defendant's negligent maintenance of the smoke detection system was a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries.

**CAUSE OF ACTION: NEGLIGENCE**  

20. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference each and every allegation in the preceding paragraphs as if fully restated herein.  

21. As the landlord and owner of the premises at 123 Maple Street, Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the premises in a safe condition, including ensuring functional and compliant smoke detection systems in common areas.  

22. Defendant’s duty to maintain functional smoke detectors is mandated by Massachusetts law, including G.L. c. 148, § 26F, which requires installation and maintenance of smoke alarms in residential buildings.  

23. Defendant breached its duty by failing to ensure that the smoke detector outside Plaintiff’s unit was operational, despite receiving notice of its non-functionality.  

24. Defendant’s failure to maintain a functioning smoke detector violated its statutory and common law duty of care.  

25. Defendant’s negligence directly and proximately caused Plaintiff’s injuries, including physical harm from smoke inhalation, medical expenses, lost wages, and damage to personal property.  

26. Massachusetts caselaw establishes that landlords may be held liable for injuries resulting from their failures to maintain statutory safety measures. See, e.g., *Haddad v. First Nat'l Stores*, 295 Mass. 590, 592 (1936) (landlord’s duty to exercise reasonable care); *Lindberg v. Huntley*, 338 Mass. 78, 84 (1958) (failure to maintain property safely constitutes negligence); *Andre v. Springfield Redevelopment Auth.*, 65 Mass. App. Ct. 453, 455 (2006) (emphasizing landlord's failure to ensure safety measures creates liability).  

27. Defendant’s actions and omissions further constituted negligence per se, as Defendant failed to comply with Massachusetts fire safety statutes, including G.L. c. 148, § 26F. See *Berlinsky v. Alpen Glow Ski Shop, Inc.*, 329 Mass. 278, 280 (1952) (violation of statutory safety requirements establishes negligence).
