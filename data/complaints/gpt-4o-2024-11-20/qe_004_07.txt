### JURISDICTION AND VENUE  

4. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 2 and G.L. c. 218, § 19 because the events giving rise to this Complaint occurred at the Property located in Worcester, Massachusetts, and the amount in controversy does not exceed the jurisdictional limits of this Court.

### FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

5. Plaintiff entered into a written lease agreement with Defendant to rent the Property, beginning January 15, 2022, for a monthly rent payment of $1,200.  

6. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff’s lease included an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, which guarantees Plaintiff’s right to occupy her rental unit free from unreasonable interference by her landlord or conditions materially affecting habitability.  

7. Around September 2025, Plaintiff began noticing mouse droppings in her kitchen, which caused significant interference with her use and enjoyment of the Property.  

8. Plaintiff promptly reported the issue to Defendant and requested that he remedy the infestation.  

9. Defendant initially placed a few traps but took no further substantive action to address or resolve the issue.  

10. While Defendant later hired an exterminator, it was limited to a single visit, which was insufficient to address the continued presence of rodents in the Property.  

11. The exterminator advised Plaintiff that the building required more comprehensive pest control measures, but Defendant refused to undertake such corrective action, calling it “overkill” and “too expensive.”  

12. Defendant has repeatedly suggested that the rodent infestation is the result of Plaintiff’s supposed lack of cleanliness, a claim Plaintiff reasonably finds insulting and baseless given her efforts to maintain a spotless home.  

13. Over the past three months, Plaintiff has continued to find mouse droppings in her kitchen on a weekly basis, despite Defendant’s limited and inadequate interventions.  

14. The presence of rodents has forced Plaintiff to discard approximately $200 worth of food products that were contaminated or potentially contaminated and to purchase $80 in plastic containers to protect her remaining food supply.  

15. The continued rodent infestation has severely interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Property and caused ongoing anxiety, frustration, and disruption to her daily life.

### CAUSE OF ACTION  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  
**(G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  

16. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1–15 as if fully set forth herein.  

17. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, every residential landlord in Massachusetts covenants that tenants shall have the quiet enjoyment of the premises free from substantial interference.  

18. Massachusetts courts have held that a landlord’s failure to address conditions materially affecting habitability constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. [See *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273, 289 (1994); *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 102 (1982)].  

19. Defendant’s persistent failure to take adequate measures to address the rodent infestation at the Property substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of her rental unit, in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

20. Defendant has failed to provide habitable living conditions as required by law. Massachusetts courts consistently hold that an ongoing rodent infestation represents a material breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. [See *McAllister v. Boston Hous. Auth.*, 429 Mass. 300, 302–03 (1999); *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196, 199 (1979)].  

21. Defendant’s failure to act constitutes an unreasonable and intentional disruption to Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her residence.  

22. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, a tenant whose landlord breaches the covenant of quiet enjoyment is entitled to recover actual damages or three months' rent, whichever is greater, as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.  

23. Defendant’s actions directly caused Plaintiff to suffer damages, including but not limited to:  
   a. Financial losses totaling $280 for discarded food and storage materials;  
   b. Emotional distress resulting from persistent anxiety about rodent contamination; and  
   c. Significant disruption to Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy her home.  

24. Plaintiff has paid all rent in full and has complied with her obligations under the lease but continues to suffer harm because of Defendant’s inaction.

### PRAYER FOR RELIEF  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grant the following relief:  

1. Award Plaintiff damages in an amount equal to three months’ rent ($3,600) or her actual damages, pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14;  

2. Award Plaintiff reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, as provided by G.L. c. 186, § 14;  

3. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
