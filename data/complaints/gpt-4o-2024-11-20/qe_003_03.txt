**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**BOSTON MUNICIPAL COURT, JAMAICA PLAIN DIVISION**  

**________________________________________**  
ALEX RIVERA,  
  Plaintiff,  

v.  

JORDAN MORGAN,  
  Defendant.  
**________________________________________**  

**COMPLAINT**  

**INTRODUCTION**  

1. This is a civil action brought by Plaintiff Alex Rivera ("Plaintiff") against Defendant Jordan Morgan ("Defendant") for damages arising from Defendant's breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, as guaranteed under Massachusetts law, including G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

2. Plaintiff seeks damages for Defendant's failure to maintain the premises in a habitable and lawful condition, which has materially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises. Plaintiff further seeks other relief as the Court deems just and proper.  

**PARTIES**  

3. Plaintiff Alex Rivera is an individual residing at 45 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130.  

4. Defendant Jordan Morgan is the owner and lessor of the residential property located at 45 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

5. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19 because the damages sought are within the jurisdictional limit of the Boston Municipal Court.  

6. Venue is proper in the Jamaica Plain Division of the Boston Municipal Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 2 and 8 because the leased premises giving rise to this claim are located in Jamaica Plain.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

7. On or about February 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant for a studio apartment located at 45 Green Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts (the “Premises”), at a monthly rent of $1,500.  

8. Prior to signing the lease, Plaintiff observed water stains on the ceiling of the Premises and inquired about the condition. Defendant assured Plaintiff that the damage was caused by an old leak that had been "totally fixed."  

9. After moving into the Premises, Plaintiff discovered that the representation by Defendant was false.  

10. During the first heavy rainstorm after Plaintiff’s tenancy began, water began dripping through the same area of the ceiling where stains were observed during the showing.  

11. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the leaking and requested repairs. Defendant, however, failed to take any meaningful or timely action, dismissing the problem as a “minor cosmetic issue.”  

12. Despite repeated complaints from Plaintiff, the water intrusion persisted and worsened. During one storm, the leak caused significant water damage, soaking Plaintiff’s couch and ruining a laptop left on the coffee table. Plaintiff replaced the laptop at a cost of $900.  

13. As time passed, the water intrusion caused additional harms, including a musty odor and, upon information and belief, the growth of mold or mildew.  

14. Plaintiff has experienced headaches and physical discomfort that Plaintiff reasonably believes are caused or exacerbated by the conditions in the Premises.  

15. The growing severity of the water and mold issues has forced Plaintiff to rearrange the apartment and avoid a substantial portion of the living space, depriving Plaintiff of the full use and enjoyment of the Premises.  

16. The above-described conditions are ongoing and have materially interfered with Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  

17. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference the allegations in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  

18. Massachusetts law, specifically G.L. c. 186, § 14, provides that a landlord who interferes with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of leased premises shall be liable for damages.  

19. Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment by failing to ensure that the leased Premises were maintained in a habitable condition, refusing to repair known defects that materially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Premises, and allowing the conditions to persist.  

20. Defendant’s breach of the covenant has caused significant and ongoing harm to Plaintiff, including damage to personal property, mental and physical distress, and a substantial deprivation of the use and enjoyment of the leased Premises.  

21. Defendant’s conduct constitutes a willful, wanton, or reckless violation of Plaintiff’s statutory rights under G.L. c. 186, § 14, entitling Plaintiff to recovery of damages, including attorneys' fees, and potentially treble damages as provided by the statute.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in their favor and grant the following relief:  

1. An award of actual damages in the amount of $900 for the property damage suffered by Plaintiff;  

2. An award of additional damages for Defendant's breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, including but not limited to damages for inconvenience, discomfort, and Plaintiff’s reduced use of the Premises;  

3. Treble damages as authorized by G.L. c. 186, § 14, for Defendant’s willful, wanton, or reckless conduct;  

4. An award of attorneys’ fees and litigation costs pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14; and  

5. Such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.  

**JURY DEMAND**  

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,  

**Dated:** December 1, 2025
