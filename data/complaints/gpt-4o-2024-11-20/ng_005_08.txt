**INTRODUCTION**  

Plaintiff Jessica Parker, by and through herself as a self-represented litigant, for her Complaint against Defendant Michael Thompson, respectfully alleges as follows:  

---

**PARTIES**  

1. Plaintiff Jessica Parker ("Plaintiff") is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts.  
2. Defendant Michael Thompson ("Defendant") is an individual residing and co-occupying a duplex located at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts.  

---

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4 because the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000.  
4. Venue is proper in Hampden County pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1 because the events giving rise to the claims occurred in Springfield, Massachusetts, which is located in Hampden County.  

---

**FACTUAL BACKGROUND**  

5. Plaintiff and Defendant reside in a shared duplex located at 123 Maple Street in Springfield, Massachusetts. Plaintiff and Defendant also share access to the property’s driveway adjacent to their respective units.  
6. Prior to March 15, 2023, Defendant stored a tall aluminum extension ladder leaning unsecured against a wooden fence near Plaintiff’s designated parking space in the shared driveway.  
7. Plaintiff had repeatedly communicated concerns to Defendant about the unsecured ladder’s potential to fall during windy conditions and cause damage. Plaintiff requested that Defendant properly secure the ladder or store it elsewhere. Defendant acknowledged Plaintiff’s concerns but failed to take any corrective action.  
8. On March 15, 2023, Springfield experienced windy conditions. While Plaintiff was backing her car into her parking space in the shared driveway, a gust of wind caused Defendant’s unsecured ladder to fall onto Plaintiff’s vehicle, damaging the hood and cracking the windshield.  
9. The ladder’s impact caused significant damage, necessitating immediate repairs, including bodywork and windshield replacement. Plaintiff was forced to pay her insurance deductible and rent a car for over a week while repairs were conducted.  
10. Defendant’s failure to secure the ladder created a hazardous condition, which directly caused the property damage sustained by Plaintiff.

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**(Negligence)**  

11. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth in paragraphs 1 through 10 as if fully stated herein.  
12. Under Massachusetts law, negligence requires the showing of: (1) a duty owed by the Defendant to the Plaintiff; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) causation; and (4) damages resulting from the breach. See **Jupin v. Kask**, 447 Mass. 141, 145 (2006).  
13. Defendant owed a duty to Plaintiff to act reasonably to avoid creating foreseeable risks of harm on the shared property, including the risks associated with storing a tall, unsecured extension ladder in a windy area near Plaintiff’s parking space. See **Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.**, 457 Mass. 368, 372 (2010) (property owners owe a duty of reasonable care to prevent foreseeable harm); **Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693, 708 (1973).  
14. Defendant breached this duty by failing to properly secure the ladder despite Plaintiff’s repeated warnings about the foreseeable risk it posed. See **Caliri v. Condouris**, 2006 WL 39152 (Mass. App. Ct. 2006) (failure to address known property hazards establishes breach of duty).  
15. Defendant knew or should have known that leaning an extension ladder against a wooden fence in windy conditions created a foreseeable risk of harm to Plaintiff’s vehicle parked nearby. See **Pessoni v. Sweet Assocs., Inc.**, 66 Mass. App. Ct. 360, 363 (2006) (reasonable property owners must recognize risks posed by foreseeable weather conditions).  
16. Defendant’s breach of duty was the direct and proximate cause of the damages Plaintiff sustained when the unsecured ladder fell onto her vehicle. See **Leavitt v. Brockton Hospital, Inc.**, 454 Mass. 37, 40 (2009) (proximate cause exists where harm is a foreseeable result of the defendant’s conduct).  
17. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff incurred financial losses, including out-of-pocket expenses to repair her vehicle and costs for a rental car during the repair period. See **Gorfinkle v. U.S. Carpet Cleaning, Inc.**, 2014 WL 7496563 (Mass. App. Ct. 2014) (damages in negligence include reasonable costs directly resulting from defendant’s actions).  

---

**DAMAGES**  

18. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and is entitled to recover the following damages:  

    a. The cost of repairing the damage to Plaintiff’s vehicle, including hood repair and windshield replacement, in the amount of approximately $2,500;  
    b. Costs incurred to rent a car while Plaintiff’s vehicle was being repaired, in the amount of approximately $400; and  
    c. Plaintiff’s cost of the insurance deductible in the amount of $500.  

---

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Parker respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment against Defendant Michael Thompson and award the following relief:  

1. Damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but not less than $3,400, plus applicable interest;  
2. Costs of this action, including but not limited to Plaintiff’s filing fees and other litigation expenses;  
3. Prejudgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law; and  
4. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

**DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL**  

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
