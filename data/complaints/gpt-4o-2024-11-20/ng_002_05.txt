---

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19, and venue is proper in Newton District Court because the negligence and resulting injuries occurred in Newton, Massachusetts.

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
5. Plaintiff was jogging on or about September 15, 2023, on a designated path in Chestnut Hill Park in Newton, Massachusetts, where posted signage requires that all dogs be restrained on leashes.  
6. Defendant, Thomas Baker, regularly allowed his dog, a large and unrestrained animal, to roam freely in the same park despite the posted leash law.  
7. On the date in question, Defendant's dog was off-leash and abruptly charged toward Plaintiff, barking loudly and startling her.  
8. At the time of the incident, Defendant was standing approximately 30 feet away with the dog's leash draped over his shoulder but without the leash attached to the dog.  
9. Fearing for her safety and uncertain whether the dog intended to bite or attack, Plaintiff swerved off the jogging path to avoid the dog.  
10. In doing so, Plaintiff tripped over a tree root and fell down a small embankment, suffering serious injuries, including a broken wrist.  
11. Several bystanders and other joggers witnessed the incident, corroborating that Plaintiff fled from the dog out of reasonable fear.  
12. As a direct result of the fall, Plaintiff incurred approximately $5,000 in medical expenses and lost wages of approximately $1,200 due to an inability to work.  
13. Additionally, Plaintiff was unable to perform and participate in a piano recital she had long prepared for, causing further emotional distress and frustration.  
14. Defendant's actions in permitting his dog to roam freely in violation of local leash laws constitute negligence, and such negligence directly and foreseeably caused Plaintiff's injuries.

**COUNT I: NEGLIGENCE**  
15. Plaintiff restates and incorporates by reference the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 14 as though fully set forth herein.  
16. Defendant owed a duty of care to Plaintiff and others in Chestnut Hill Park to act as a reasonable person would under the circumstances.  
17. Under Massachusetts law, Defendant had a specific duty to comply with Newton's leash law ordinances, and his failure to do so created an unreasonable risk of harm to others.  
18. Defendant breached this duty of care by failing to restrain his dog with a leash and allowing it to run loose, despite knowing or having reason to know that such behavior could frighten or threaten parkgoers like Plaintiff.  
19. Defendant knew or should have known that his actions in failing to restrain his dog could cause a reasonably foreseeable injury, such as Plaintiff's. See *Poskus v. Lombardo's of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637, 639 (1996) (stating that foreseeability of harm is a critical element in determining negligence).  
20. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's breach of duty, Plaintiff suffered physical injuries, including a broken wrist, economic damages in the form of medical expenses and lost wages, and emotional distress and loss of enjoyment of life. See *Jupin v. Kask*, 447 Mass. 141, 147 (2006) (discussing the duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent foreseeable injury).  
21. Massachusetts adheres to the general principle that individuals have a duty to use reasonable care to prevent harm to others, and Defendant's failure to do so constitutes negligence. See *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000).  
22. Defendant's actions are also a violation of Newton's leash laws, which creates evidence of negligence per se. See *LaClair v. Silberline Mfg. Co., Inc.*, 379 Mass. 21, 29 (1979) (violation of a statute or ordinance enacted for public safety may constitute evidence of negligence).
