**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**MIDDLESEX COUNTY PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT**  
Docket No. ___________________  

**EMILY JOHNSON,**    
  Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MICHAEL SMITH**,  
  Defendant.  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**

**INTRODUCTION AND JURISDICTION**  

1. The Plaintiff, Emily Johnson (“Plaintiff”), brings this Complaint for Modification pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 208, § 31, seeking modification of the existing custody and parenting order for the parties’ minor child, Jacob Smith, born March 25, 2017.  

2. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 215, § 6 as the Middlesex County Probate and Family Court issued the original custody order dated May 14, 2019 (“Original Order”).  

3. A material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the Original Order, warranting a modification that serves the best interests of the minor child.  

**PARTIES**  

4. The Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, resides at 123 Main Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and is the primary custodial parent of the minor child.  

5. The Defendant, Michael Smith, resides at 456 Elm Street, Somerville, Massachusetts, and currently exercises parenting time as outlined in the Original Order.  

6. The parties are the parents of Jacob Smith. No other custody orders or judgments applicable to the minor child exist other than the Original Order issued by this Court on May 14, 2019.  

**FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND ALLEGATIONS**  

7. The Original Order granted Emily Johnson primary physical custody of the minor child with Michael Smith receiving three weekly visits, each lasting a few hours, and Sunday afternoon visits. No overnight parenting time was granted to Michael Smith due to his then living situation, which consisted of a shared apartment with roommates and insufficient space to accommodate the child.  

8. Since the entry of the Original Order on May 14, 2019, there has been a significant and material change in circumstances that makes the current parenting plan no longer practical or in the best interests of the minor child.  

9. The material changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to:  
   a. **The child’s developmental and educational needs:** At the time of the Original Order, Jacob Smith was only three years old. He is now eight years old and enrolled full-time in school, with routine homework assignments and an established need for a consistent bedtime.  
   b. **The father’s improved living situation:** Michael Smith now resides in a private apartment where Jacob Smith has his own bedroom and appropriate accommodations for overnight visitation.  
   c. **Exhaustion and disruption caused by the current schedule:** The current schedule requires Jacob Smith to commute between homes for brief visits on school nights, causing unnecessary stress and disruption to the child’s homework, extracurricular activities, and bedtime routines.  
   d. **The child’s expressed desire for overnight time with his father:** Jacob Smith frequently expresses his desire for overnight visits at his father’s home.  

10. The current parenting plan creates practical difficulties for both parents, as well as the child, and prevents the minor child from enjoying the benefit of meaningful and age-appropriate time with both parents.  

11. Both parents agree that the current schedule is unsustainable and not in the best interests of the minor child.  

12. A modification of custody and parenting time is necessary to ensure that the minor child’s developmental, emotional, and educational needs are met in a manner consistent with his age and best interests.  

**LEGAL ARGUMENT**  

13. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, a custody order may be modified upon the showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances that affects the best interests of the child.  

14. The Massachusetts courts have long held that the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration in determining custodial arrangements. See Charara v. Yatim, 78 Mass. App. Ct. 325 (2010); Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).  

15. Changes in a child’s developmental needs, educational requirements, and the improved circumstances of a parent constitute material and substantial changes justifying modification of a custody order. See Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981); Pizzino v. Miller, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006).  

16. The child’s age, expressed preferences, and the disruption caused by excessive transfers are relevant in determining the child’s best interests. See Hunter v. Rose, 463 Mass. 488 (2012); Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).  

17. The guidelines for custody and parenting plans emphasize stability for the child while fostering a meaningful relationship with both parents. See G.L. c. 208, § 31; Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182 (1998).  

18. Given Michael Smith’s stable living arrangement and the challenges caused by the current schedule, modification is necessary to avoid emotional and academic detriment to Jacob Smith. See Stinson v. Meegan, 60 Mass. App. Ct. 302 (2004); Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996).  

**REQUEST FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Modify the Original Order entered on May 14, 2019, to develop a parenting schedule that better reflects the current circumstances of the minor child and the parties;  

2. Establish a schedule that includes regular overnight parenting time for Michael Smith;  

3. Issue any and all further orders it deems just and proper under the circumstances.  

Respectfully submitted,  

**Dated:** December 1, 2025
