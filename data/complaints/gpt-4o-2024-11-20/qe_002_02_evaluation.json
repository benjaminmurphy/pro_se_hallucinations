Instead, it holds that a landlord\u2019s failure to take reasonable measures to address third-party criminal activity that seriously interferes with tenants\u2019 use of common areas may constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. The opinion focuses on interference with use (quiet enjoyment), not on habitability doctrine, so it does not support the specific proposition that failure to address habitability issues constitutes a breach of quiet enjoyment.",

The court explains that \u201cquiet enjoyment\u201d covers serious interferences with the tenancy and expressly holds Gem liable under \u00a7 14 because it violated its duty to maintain sanitary conditions and allowed repeated flooding that interfered with Solomon\u2019s quiet enjoyment. That directly supports the proposition that failure to address unsafe or habitability conditions can constitute a breach of quiet enjoyment in Massachusetts.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe phrase \u2018quiet enjoyment\u2019 is a familiar term in landlord-tenant law, signifying the tenant\u2019s right to freedom from serious interferences with his tenancy \u2014 acts or omissions that \u2018impair the character and value of the leased premises.\u2019\u2026 Every tenancy is deemed to entail an implied covenant that the landlord will not disturb this right during the tenancy\u2026 Finally, Gem is liable to Solomon under G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14 because it violated its underlying duty to maintain sanitary conditions in her apartment, and thereby permitted repeated flooding to occur that interfered with her quiet enjoyment of her apartment.\u201d"

The Court cites prior cases involving failure to repair water-related defects (e.g., leaky roof, flooding) as paradigmatic \u00a7 14 violations, and clarifies that when a landlord has notice of a problem and fails to take appropriate corrective measures, liability under the covenant may be imposed. Thus, a defendant\u2019s failure to address water intrusion after notice fits squarely within the principle articulated in this opinion.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "We noted that a landlord\u2019s failure \u201cto repair defects of which he has notice in leased premises is an omission which frequently has been deemed to violate \u00a7 14.\u201d See Cruz, supra at 789, citing Simon v. Solomon, supra at 103 (failure to control floods in tenant\u2019s apartment); Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth., 378 Mass. 758, 761 (1979) (failure to repair leaky roof)\u2026 Today we make clear what was implicit in those rulings: to support the imposition of liability under the quiet enjoyment statute, there must be a showing of at least negligent conduct by a landlord\u2026 it must be demonstrated that the landlord had notice of or reason to know of the presence of [the condition] and failed to take appropriate corrective measures."

It does not involve landlord retaliation, lease renewal decisions, code-violation reporting, or interference with quiet enjoyment.
