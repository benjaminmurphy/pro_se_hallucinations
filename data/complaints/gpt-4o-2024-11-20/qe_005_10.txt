*Plaintiff,*  

v.  

**Mark Henderson**  
[Landlord's Address]  
Somerville, Massachusetts [ZIP],  

*Defendant.*  

CIVIL ACTION NO.: [Leave Blank for Court to Assign]  

### COMPLAINT  

Plaintiff Rachel Thompson, by and for herself, brings this action against Defendant Mark Henderson and alleges as follows:  

---

### INTRODUCTION  

1. This is an action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, as secured by Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, § 14, for the Defendant's failure to address ongoing disturbances caused by other tenants over an extended period of time. Plaintiff has suffered significant personal and financial harm as a result.  

---

### PARTIES  

2. Plaintiff Rachel Thompson is an individual residing at 45 Willow Street, Second Floor, Somerville, Massachusetts 02144. She has resided at this property since January 1, 2022, pursuant to a valid and enforceable lease agreement.  

3. Defendant Mark Henderson is a landlord and property owner, residing or doing business in Somerville, Massachusetts. At all relevant times, Defendant owned and managed the premises located at 45 Willow Street, including the second-floor apartment rented by Plaintiff.  

---

### JURISDICTION AND VENUE  

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 1, as this is a civil action in which the damages claimed exceed $25.  

5. Venue is proper in Somerville District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 2, because the events giving rise to this action occurred within this Court's jurisdiction, and the Defendant conducts business in Somerville, Massachusetts.  

---

### FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

6. On or about January 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a written lease agreement with Defendant for the rental of an apartment located at 45 Willow Street, Somerville, Massachusetts.  

7. Under the terms of the lease and Massachusetts law, Defendant warranted to Plaintiff the covenant of quiet enjoyment of her residence.  

8. Beginning approximately six months ago, tenants living in the third-floor apartment of 45 Willow Street, also leased and managed by Defendant, have caused excessive and persistent noise disturbances.  

9. The noise disturbances include but are not limited to loud stomping, late-night music, and what sounds like furniture being moved at unreasonable hours, often interrupting Plaintiff’s sleep.  

10. Plaintiff promptly and repeatedly complained about these disturbances to the Defendant, beginning approximately in June 2025, and continuing thereafter on at least five separate occasions.  

11. Defendant initially spoke with the tenants in the third-floor apartment but failed to take any further steps to resolve the issue, later stating to Plaintiff that he "can't control how people live."  

12. As a direct result of Defendant’s inaction, Plaintiff has been deprived of the quiet enjoyment of her apartment, which has caused her significant harm, including lack of sleep, work-related disciplinary action, and medical costs.  

13. Plaintiff has incurred monthly expenses of $40 for sleep medication, as prescribed by her doctor, to address noise-induced insomnia.  

14. Defendant’s failure to address these issues constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, as codified within G.L. c. 186, § 14, and violates Plaintiff’s rights under Massachusetts landlord-tenant law.

### CAUSES OF ACTION  

**COUNT I: BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**  

15. Plaintiff incorporates all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  

16. Under Massachusetts law, the covenant of quiet enjoyment, codified at G.L. c. 186, § 14, is an express or implied condition of every residential lease agreement.  

17. Defendant, as Plaintiff’s landlord, has a statutory and contractual obligation to ensure quiet enjoyment of the leased premises.  

18. Massachusetts courts have repeatedly held that persistent and excessive noise caused by one tenant that substantially interferes with another tenant's use and enjoyment of their leased premises can constitute a violation of quiet enjoyment. See *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273, 279 (1994); *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 102 (1982).  

19. Despite repeated notice and complaints by Plaintiff, Defendant failed to take reasonable action to abate the noise disturbances caused by third-floor tenants and instead dismissed or ignored Plaintiff’s concerns.  

20. Defendant’s inaction constitutes a breach of his obligations under G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

21. As a result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer damages, including but not limited to:  
   a. Severe sleep deprivation, resulting in adverse health effects;  
   b. Financial costs, including the cost of sleep medication in the amount of $40 per month;  
   c. Interference with her professional life, including a written warning at work due to fatigue; and  
   d. Loss of the full benefit of her rented premises.  

22. Plaintiff is entitled to recover actual and consequential damages, as well as statutory damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14, which mandates payment of three times actual damages, or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus attorneys’ fees.  

---

### PRAYER FOR RELIEF  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Rachel Thompson respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment against Defendant Mark Henderson as follows:  

1. Awarding Plaintiff actual and consequential damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but no less than $2,400.00, plus statutory treble damages under G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

2. Awarding Plaintiff reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of suit pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

3. Awarding any other relief deemed just and equitable by the Court.  

---

### JURY DEMAND  

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues properly triable to a jury.
