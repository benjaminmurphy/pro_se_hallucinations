With respect to each such claim, the plaintiffs bear the burden of proving that the defendant committed a breach of the duty to use reasonable care, that the plaintiffs suffered actual loss, and that the defendant\u2019s negligence caused their loss. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 281 (1965); J.R. Nolan & L.J. Sartorio, Tort Law \u00a7 204 (2d ed. 1989). Causation is an essential element of that proof.\u201d"
