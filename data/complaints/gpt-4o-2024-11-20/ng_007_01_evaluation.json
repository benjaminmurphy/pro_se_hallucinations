The accident occurred when Albert attempted to make a left turn and Antonellis\u2019 truck struck the passenger side of Albert\u2019s automobile, severely injuring Philip."

The court\u2019s duty, causation, and statutory analyses are specific to police interaction with intoxicated motorists and protection of the motoring public, and do not address childcare settings or supervision of children in any way.

It does not articulate or apply any standard about institutional defendants ignoring reports of dangerous behavior or failing to prevent foreseeable harm. Thus, this citation does not support the specific negligence/foreseeability standard claimed in the proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"The court holds that the measure of responsibility of an occupier should no longer depend on whether the injured person is characterized as a 'licensee' rather than an 'invitee,' or vice versa; the question is to turn on other, more vital factors. But footnote 7 seems to say that 'trespassers' stand apart, that that characterization is to remain decisive or highly influential. This tends to perpetuate, although on a smaller scale, the kind of tradition-bound and mistaken analysis that I had supposed the court was aiming to correct.\""
