The court expressly notes it is not deciding whether the employer\u2011employee relationship creates special duties, and it does not discuss the general duty of a landowner or business proprietor toward members of the public. Therefore it does not support the claimed proposition about a business\u2019s duty of care to patrons on its premises.",

First, the plaintiffs argue that the defendants voluntarily assumed a duty to protect Foley against attacks by third parties. \u2026 Second, the plaintiffs claim that the employer-employee relationship between the BHA and Foley gave rise to a duty to protect Foley against attacks by third parties. Under either theory, in order for liability to be imposed, the plaintiffs are required to prove that Ferris\u2019s attack on Foley was foreseeable.\u201d"

It does not itself set out or apply a specific duty of care for business owners toward patrons, nor does it discuss maintaining premises in a reasonably safe condition or warning of known or knowable hazards. While the main Mounsey decision is indeed about premises liability and duties of care, nothing in this particular quoted passage clearly supports the detailed proposition stated.",

But footnote 7 seems to say that \u2018trespassers\u2019 stand apart, that that characterization is to remain decisive or highly influential.\""

Instead, the court holds that the nightclub had notice of the inherent risk of spills due to its mode of operation and that the mode-of-operation doctrine satisfies the notice requirement without proof of actual or constructive notice of this particular spill.

However, the case is not about pleading or proving that a plaintiff suffered physical injuries, emotional distress, lost income, and medical expenses as a direct and proximate result of a defendant\u2019s negligence; rather, it concerns a lawful visitor\u2019s ability to recover for personal injuries under an implied warranty of habitability and related evidentiary issues.
