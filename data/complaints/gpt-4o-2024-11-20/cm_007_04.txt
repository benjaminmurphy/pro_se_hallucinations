### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER

**INTRODUCTION**

This Complaint is brought pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 209C, § 20, requesting that the Court modify its prior custody order dated March 12, 2019, which established a 50/50 physical custody arrangement between the parties for their minor child, Sophia Smith. Plaintiff alleges that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances which makes the current custody arrangement no longer in the best interests of the child.

**PARTIES**

1. The Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, resides at 123 Main Street, Taunton, Massachusetts. Plaintiff is the mother of the parties' minor child, Sophia Smith.
2. The Defendant, Mark Smith, resides at 456 Oak Lane, Fall River, Massachusetts. Defendant is the father of the minor child.

**JURISDICTION**

3. The Probate and Family Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 208 and G.L. c. 209C, as the original custody order was issued in this Court, and the parties and minor child continue to reside in Massachusetts.

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

4. On March 12, 2019, the Court issued a judgment in the above-captioned matter, granting the parties shared physical custody of their minor child, Sophia Smith, with a parenting schedule consisting of alternating one-week parenting time.

5. For several years, the 50/50 custody arrangement worked well, as both parties resided in close proximity to each other, were in good health, and shared responsibilities equitably.

6. Recently, Defendant Mark Smith has been diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition that has substantially impacted his ability to care for the minor child safely and consistently.

7. Defendant has experienced multiple falls at home, a fact confirmed by medical documentation and Plaintiff's observation, and his medical provider has advised him not to engage in certain activities that require quick physical responses, such as safely supervising the child near stairs or engaging in activities involving physical exertion.

8. Despite his condition, Defendant insists on maintaining the 50/50 custody arrangement but has not demonstrated that he can adequately handle his share of the responsibilities without placing undue burdens on the minor child.

9. Plaintiff has observed that Defendant frequently relies on their twelve-year-old daughter to assist him with tasks such as moving from his wheelchair to his bed and retrieving items. This imposes age-inappropriate caregiving responsibilities on the child and has disrupted her routines and emotional well-being.

10. On information and belief, Defendant has declined additional outside caregiving assistance that could mitigate the risks associated with his condition, further exacerbating the minor child's exposure to unsafe and unhealthy situations.

11. Plaintiff seeks to modify the parenting schedule so that the minor child is primarily in her care, while Defendant retains parenting time that is consistent with his current abilities and the child's best interests.

12. Plaintiff’s proposed modification is centered on the minor child’s best interests, in compliance with G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 209C, § 20, which require “real advantage” to the child in any proposed modification (Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704, 710 (1985)).

**LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION**

13. A parenting arrangement established by court order may be modified upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and when such modification is in the child's best interests (G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20; Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734, 738 (1996)).

14. Defendant's diagnosis of a progressive neurological condition constitutes a material change in circumstances that significantly impacts his ability to meet the minor child’s needs and safeguard her well-being.

15. The Massachusetts courts have consistently held that a child's safety, welfare, and happiness are paramount considerations in custody determinations (Hunter v. Rose, 463 Mass. 488, 494 (2012); Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182, 187 (1998)).

16. Imposing age-inappropriate caregiving responsibilities on the child constitutes a disruption of her best interests and justifies modification of the custody order (Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177, 182-83 (2006)).

17. Massachusetts law recognizes that a stable and safe environment is critical to a child’s development, and modifications may be warranted to ensure this stability (Chapin v. Chapin, 447 Mass. 565, 572 (2006)).

18. Where one parent can no longer effectively safeguard the child’s physical and emotional well-being, the Court has discretion to reassign custodial responsibilities to the other parent to serve the child’s best interests (Woodside v. Woodside, 79 Mass. App. Ct. 713, 718 (2011)).

19. Plaintiff's proposed modification ensures that the minor child can maintain a consistent routine in a safe and stable environment, in alignment with the principles outlined in Massachusetts case law and statutory authority.

**REQUESTED RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:  

1. Modify the existing custody order dated March 12, 2019, to grant Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, primary physical custody of the minor child, Sophia Smith, with reasonable parenting time for Defendant, Mark Smith, consistent with his current abilities and the child’s best interests.  

2. Order any additional relief necessary to address and safeguard the minor child’s physical and emotional well-being.  

3. Award Plaintiff attorney’s fees and costs, if applicable.

**Respectfully submitted,**  

**Emily Johnson**
