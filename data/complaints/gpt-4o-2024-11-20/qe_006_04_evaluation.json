It does not address habitability issues like lack of hot water or other essential physical services, and it explicitly cabins the warranty of habitability to physical defects. The opinion therefore cannot be cited as authority that failure to maintain a habitable unit or provide essential services such as hot water constitutes a violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe covenant of quiet enjoyment protects a tenant\u2019s right to freedom from serious interference with his tenancy \u2014 acts or omissions that impair the character and value of the leasehold. \u2026 [A] landlord may not intend to violate a tenant\u2019s right to quiet enjoyment, but may do so nevertheless when the breach is a \u2018natural and probable consequence of what the landlord did, what he failed to do, or what he permitted to be done.\u2019 \u2026 If the defendant failed to take any action to remove from the area of its control persons engaged in unlawful activity, then the defendant permitted a condition to exist that substantially interfered with the tenancies of the plaintiffs and thus breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment.\u201d"

The court\u2019s discussion of \u00a7 14 focuses on interference with quiet enjoyment through unsanitary flooding, not on failure to supply or repair hot water, so using this case as authority for the specific hot-water proposition mischaracterizes its holding.",

It neither interprets G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 14 nor holds that a failure to restore hot water after notice constitutes constructive eviction, so it does not support the specific proposition cited.",

There is nothing to suggest that our courts which have heretofore given relief to a tenant who is the victim of a \u2018constructive eviction\u2019 will not continue to do so in an appropriate case.\u201d"

The court focuses on rent-based damages and statutory remedies (including attorney\u2019s fees and potential multiple damages), and explicitly notes that Thomas is not entitled to additional actual damages under G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, or c. 93A. The specific proposition about \u2018stress, inconvenience, and indignity\u2019 as compensable actual damages is not supported by this case.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "General Laws c. 186, \u00a7 14 (1992 ed.), provides, in pertinent part, that \u201cany lessor or landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant . . . shall ... be liable for actual and consequential damages or three month\u2019s rent, whichever is greater, and the costs of the action, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d ...
