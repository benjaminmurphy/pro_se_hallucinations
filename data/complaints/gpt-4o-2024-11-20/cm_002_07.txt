**INTRODUCTION**  

This Complaint is filed by the Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, requesting that the Court modify the existing custody and visitation order entered on May 15, 2021. A material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the issuance of the original order. The existing parenting plan has become unworkable and is no longer in the best interests of the parties' minor child, Emily Miller, age 8.  

**JURISDICTION**  

1. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 209C, § 20 and G.L. c. 208, § 28, as the child resides primarily with the Plaintiff in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and the existing custody order was entered in this Court.  

**FACTUAL BACKGROUND**  

2. The Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, and Defendant, Jason Miller, are the biological parents of Emily Miller, who was born on [Child’s Date of Birth].  

3. On May 15, 2021, the Middlesex County Probate and Family Court issued a custody order establishing that the Plaintiff has primary physical custody of Emily, with the Defendant having visitation every Wednesday and every other weekend.  

4. At the time of the original order, both parties resided in the Cambridge, Massachusetts area, and the child attended a local school.  

5. The parenting schedule, including Wednesday overnight visits, was based on the proximity of both parties' residences, allowing for minimal disruption to Emily’s school and extracurricular activities.  

6. Recently, the Defendant has informed the Plaintiff of his intention to relocate to New Hampshire for a new job opportunity, approximately 90 minutes away from the child's school in Cambridge under normal traffic conditions.  

7. Despite this relocation, the Defendant seeks to continue the current custody schedule as it exists, including midweek overnights.  

8. As a result of the Defendant’s relocation, the child would be required to undertake lengthy and burdensome travel between Cambridge and New Hampshire for midweek visits, creating significant disruption to Emily’s school schedule, extracurricular activities, and overall well-being.  

9. Emily has already exhibited signs of anxiety about these long drives and the impact of midweek overnights on her school and social activities.  

10. Maintaining the current schedule would adversely affect Emily’s best interests, as it would cause undue interruption to her education, sleep schedule, and participation in after-school activities, and it would negatively impact her emotional stability.  

11. The Plaintiff has proposed a modification to the parenting schedule that eliminates the Wednesday midweek overnight visits and adjusts weekend visitation to reflect the increased travel distance, but the Defendant has been unwilling to agree to these changes.  

**BASIS FOR MODIFICATION**  

12. A material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred due to the Defendant's planned relocation to New Hampshire, which was not contemplated at the time of the original custody order.  

13. The current custody order is no longer in Emily’s best interests, as it no longer serves to promote her stability, well-being, and ability to thrive in her educational and social environments.  

14. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and related case law, a modification of custody or visitation orders may be granted when there is a material and substantial change in circumstances and modification serves the best interests of the child.  

15. The best interests of the child standard is the paramount consideration in Massachusetts custody cases. See *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985); *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012).  

16. The planned relocation by the Defendant constitutes a significant disruption to the original assumptions underlying the parenting plan, and the Court has long held that the impact of such relocations can justify modification of custody orders when the child's best interests are affected. See *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981); *Kindregan v. Kindregan*, 377 Mass. 272 (1979).  

17. A midweek overnight visit, requiring Emily to travel 90 minutes each way, undermines her stability and conflicts with her educational and social commitments. Massachusetts courts recognize that preserving a child's stability is critical in custody arrangements. See *Bak v. Bak*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 608 (1987).  

18. The Plaintiff's proposed schedule reflects a reasonable, child-focused adjustment that prioritizes Emily's well-being and stability, consistent with the best interests standard. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).  

19. The Plaintiff further requests that the Court consider the reduced ability of the current schedule to promote Emily's mental health and emotional well-being, which is paramount in any custody modification proceeding. See *Hale v. Hale*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 812 (1982); *Guardianship of Estelle*, 70 Mass. App. Ct. 575 (2007).  

**REQUEST FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Modify the custody and visitation order entered on May 15, 2021, to reflect that:    
   a. The midweek overnight visits by the Defendant be eliminated to avoid disruptive and burdensome travel for Emily.    
   b. Weekend visitation be adjusted to account for the increased travel distance between the parties’ residences while ensuring Emily's stability and well-being.    

2. Grant such further relief as the Court deems necessary and appropriate in the best interests of the minor child, Emily Miller.
