**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

7. Plaintiff entered into a written lease agreement with Defendant on or about January 1, 2022, for the rental of the second-floor apartment located at 25 Union Square, Somerville, MA 02143.  

8. Plaintiff’s lease explicitly guarantees Plaintiff’s right to "quiet enjoyment" as required under Massachusetts law.  

9. Defendant is the landlord for all tenants in the residential property located at 25 Union Square, including those occupying the third-floor apartment directly above Plaintiff’s unit.  

10. In or around June 2025, tenants on the third floor began engaging in persistent and unreasonable noise disturbances, including but not limited to stomping, furniture moving, and loud music, often during late-night hours.  

11. Plaintiff took reasonable steps to address the problem by politely asking the third-floor tenants to reduce the noise; however, these efforts only briefly mitigated the problem.  

12. Plaintiff reported the noise disturbances to Defendant on at least five separate occasions, the first of which occurred in June 2025.  

13. Defendant’s initial response was to speak to the third-floor tenants; however, Defendant thereafter refused to take further action, stating that he “can't control how people live.”  

14. Defendant’s failure to act resulted in the continuation of persistent, unreasonable noise disturbances, which severely disrupted Plaintiff’s ability to sleep and live peacefully in the premises.  

15. As a direct result of the noise disturbances and Defendant’s failure to act:  
    a. Plaintiff typically sleeps only four to five hours per night;  
    b. Plaintiff has received a written warning at work after falling asleep at their desk;  
    c. Plaintiff incurred out-of-pocket costs of $40 per month for prescription sleep medication recommended by Plaintiff’s doctor;  
    d. Plaintiff purchased earplugs, a white noise machine, and rearranged their bedroom, in an unsuccessful effort to mitigate the noise without Defendant's assistance.  

16. Plaintiff paid monthly rent of $1,800 throughout the entire course of these disturbances despite Defendant’s failure to ensure Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the premises.  

17. Defendant’s actions and inactions constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment in violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14.

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment)**  

18. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  

19. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Massachusetts law imposes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment in all residential lease agreements.  

20. A landlord violates the covenant of quiet enjoyment if they interfere, directly or indirectly, with a tenant’s ability to use and enjoy their leased premises.  

21. As the landlord of the property located at 25 Union Square, Somerville, MA, Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to ensure Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment.  

22. The persistent noise disturbances caused by tenants under Defendant’s control, and Defendant’s unreasonable failure to address these disturbances upon notice, constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the premises.  

23. Defendant’s conduct was willful, intentional, and in knowing disregard of Plaintiff’s legal rights.  

24. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has suffered damages, including but not limited to:  
    a. Emotional distress from sleep deprivation;  
    b. Economic losses, including $40 per month spent on medical expenses;  
    c. Physical and mental health consequences of interrupted sleep; and  
    d. Costs incurred for mitigating the noise disturbances and living in the premises without adequate quiet enjoyment.  

25. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for actual damages and potentially attorney’s fees and costs.

b. Award Plaintiff damages in an amount no less than $1,200 to compensate Plaintiff for losses resulting from Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;
