      "support_reasoning": "The opinion in Dartmouth v. Silva deals exclusively with the procedural doctrine of res judicata and the effect of judgments entered after sustaining demurrers; it does not address landlord-tenant law, implied duties of a landlord, or any substantive obligations of landlords under Massachusetts law. Because the case is about claim preclusion and not about landlord duties, it cannot be cited as authority for a violation of implied landlord duties.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"The defence of res judicata ordinarily must rest upon the fact that a judgment upon the merits had been entered in the former litigation... The general rule in this Commonwealth is that a judgment following the sustaining of a demurrer is not a bar to a second action for the same cause of action. It has been stated that 'The reason for the rule is that such a judgment commonly is based not on the merits but upon the insufficiency of the statement of the cause of action.'\""
