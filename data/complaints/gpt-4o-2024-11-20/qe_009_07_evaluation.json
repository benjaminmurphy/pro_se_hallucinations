The court explains that \u2018quiet enjoyment\u2019 covers serious interferences with the character and value of the leased premises and that liability does not require specific intent, but extends to at least reckless omissions to act. This matches the proposition that a landlord\u2019s failure to remedy conditions that substantially interfere with a tenant\u2019s enjoyment violates quiet enjoyment under \u00a7 14 and related case law.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe phrase \u2018quiet enjoyment\u2019 is a familiar term in landlord-tenant law, signifying the tenant\u2019s right to freedom from serious interferences with his tenancy \u2014 acts or omissions that \u2018impair the character and value of the leased premises.\u2019 \u2026 When the Legislature chose the words \u2018quiet enjoyment\u2019\u2026 it must have intended to incorporate these cases into the statute. \u2026 Finally, Gem is liable to Solomon under \u00a7 14 because it violated its underlying duty to maintain sanitary conditions in her apartment, and thereby permitted repeated flooding to occur that interfered with her quiet enjoyment of her apartment.\u201d"

Olanoff concerns constructive eviction and breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment due to excessive noise from a bar, not the unusable condition of a specific room such as a second bedroom. The opinion focuses on whether the landlords\u2019 conduct and control over the noisy lounge barred them from collecting rent; it does not address partial uninhabitability of a unit or compensatory damages for loss of a particular bedroom. Thus, it does not provide authority for the specific proposition claimed.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cBecause the disturbing condition was the natural and probable consequence of the landlords\u2019 permitting the lounge to operate where it did and because the landlords could control the actions at the lounge, they should not be entitled to collect rent for residential premises which were not reasonably habitable. Tenants such as these should not be left only with a claim against the proprietors of the noisome lounge.\u201d"
