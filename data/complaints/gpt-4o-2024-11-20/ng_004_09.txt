### **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

7. On or about February 15, 2023, Plaintiff Jacob Adams was delivering groceries to a third-floor tenant at 123 Maple Street, Worcester, Massachusetts.

8. Defendant Linda Greene, as the owner of the property at 123 Maple Street, had a legal duty to maintain the abutting sidewalk in a reasonably safe condition for lawful visitors, including timely removal of snow and ice, pursuant to G.L. c. 84, § 7A.

9. Following a snowstorm in February 2023, Defendant shoveled a narrow path down the middle of the sidewalk abutting her property but failed to apply salt, sand, or any other material to prevent the formation of ice.

10. Due to daily thawing and refreezing cycles, the shoveled path turned into a sheet of ice, creating a hazardous condition for pedestrians, including Plaintiff.

11. Tenants of the property repeatedly contacted Defendant to notify her of the icy and dangerous condition on the sidewalk and sent her photographs of the hazard. Defendant responded that "the sun will take care of it," failing to address the ongoing risk.

12. At approximately 11:30 a.m. on February 15, 2023, Plaintiff slipped and fell on the ice while walking on the sidewalk to deliver groceries. Plaintiff fell backward onto the ice, striking his lower back.

13. Plaintiff sustained serious injuries as a result of the fall, including but not limited to a lower back strain and associated pain, which required medical treatment.

14. Plaintiff incurred approximately $2,500 in medical bills for necessary treatment following the fall. Additionally, Plaintiff was unable to work for one week and sustained lost wages totaling approximately $800.

15. Defendant knew or should have known about the hazardous condition of the sidewalk and failed to take reasonable steps to eliminate or warn of the danger, in violation of her duty of care and applicable Massachusetts law.

### **CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**(Negligence)**  

16. Plaintiff reasserts and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1-15 as if fully set forth herein.

17. At all times relevant hereto, Defendant had a duty of reasonable care to maintain the sidewalk abutting 123 Maple Street in a safe condition, including the timely removal of snow and ice, pursuant to G.L. c. 84, § 7A and related Massachusetts law.

18. Defendant breached her duty of care by failing to adequately maintain the sidewalk and failing to address the known ice hazard despite receiving notice from tenants about the dangerous condition.

19. Defendant explicitly disregarded her duty of care by negligently responding, "the sun will take care of it," instead of taking reasonable measures to remove or mitigate the icy hazard.

20. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff slipped and fell on February 15, 2023, sustaining serious injuries to his lower back.

21. Defendant’s failure to act constitutes negligence under Massachusetts common law as established in *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368 (2010), which held property owners liable for failures to address unnatural accumulations of snow and ice.

22. Defendant’s conduct further violated the standard of care imposed under G.L. c. 84, § 7A, which requires property owners to remove snow and ice from abutting sidewalks to prevent injuries such as those suffered by Plaintiff.

23. Massachusetts courts have consistently found property owners liable for negligently maintaining icy sidewalks, where such conditions presented a foreseeable danger to lawful visitors. See, e.g., *Sweeney v. Raoul*, 428 Mass. 579 (1998); *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973); *Schiffman v. City of Boston*, 84 Mass. App. Ct. 285 (2013).

24. Defendant’s failure to act reasonably under the circumstances created a foreseeable and unreasonable risk of harm to Plaintiff and others, violating the standard of care outlined in cases including *Young v. Garwacki*, 380 Mass. 162 (1980), and *Deyesso v. Testa*, 406 Mass. 102 (1989).

25. As a result of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff has suffered, and continues to suffer, serious injuries, medical expenses, lost wages, and emotional distress, all of which were proximately caused by Defendant's negligent acts and omissions.
