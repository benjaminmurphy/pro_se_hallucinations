In support of this Complaint, the Plaintiff states as follows:**  

---

1. **Plaintiff:** Jessica Turner is an individual residing at [Plaintiff’s address]. She is the mother of Emily Turner, age 12.

---

### **II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 209C, § 20, as the issues involve the custody and well-being of a minor child residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  
4. Venue is proper in the Berkshire Probate and Family Court under G.L. c. 209C, § 3, as the matter arises out of prior proceedings in this Court and the parties reside within its jurisdiction.

### **III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**  

5. On or about May 15, 2018, this Court entered a judgment of shared custody granting the Plaintiff and Defendant joint physical custody of their minor daughter, Emily Turner, with each parent caring for Emily on a week-on/week-off basis.  
6. At the time the original custody order was issued, both parties resided nearby one another, were physically healthy, and equally capable of providing a stable environment for the child. Both parties abided by the terms of the agreement over the intervening years.  
7. In recent months, the Defendant, Michael Turner, has been diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition that substantially limits his physical abilities. His condition has resulted in frequent falls at home, reduced mobility, and ongoing physical challenges in performing basic caregiving tasks.  
8. As part of the Defendant’s medical care, his treating physician has reportedly recommended that he avoid situations requiring rapid physical movement or activities involving stairs when alone with Emily Turner.  
9. Despite these medical recommendations, the Defendant has insisted on maintaining the 50/50 shared custody arrangement as originally ordered in 2018, which places Emily in his care one week at a time without regard for his physical condition.  
10. During Emily’s parenting time with the Defendant, she is frequently required to assist her father with physically demanding tasks, such as helping him transfer in and out of his wheelchair, retrieving medical or household items, and managing his home environment. This places an undue burden on the minor child and creates stress and potential safety concerns.  
11. The Plaintiff has proposed modifications to increase her physical custody of Emily to ensure stability, consistency, and safety, while still reserving reasonable parenting time for the Defendant that accommodates his abilities and limitations; however, the Defendant has refused such proposals.

### **IV. MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**  

12. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and relevant Massachusetts precedent, this Court is authorized to modify existing custody orders upon a showing of a "material change in circumstances" and when such modification promotes the best interests of the child.  
13. The Defendant’s progressive neurological condition, declining physical health, and resulting inability to safely care for Emily without assistance constitutes a material change in circumstances since the prior custody order was entered.  
14. Massachusetts law establishes that any custody arrangement must prioritize the safety, stability, and best interests of the minor child. See Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 841-42 (2003); Custody of a Minor, 389 Mass. 755, 766-67 (1983).  
15. Where the Defendant’s physical limitations have rendered him unable to provide the same level of care and supervision as when the initial order was entered, a modification is necessary. See Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 260 (2001) (modification warranted where there is a clear change affecting the child’s welfare).  

---

### **V. REQUESTED MODIFICATION**  

16. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter an order modifying the custody arrangement to award primary physical custody to Jessica Turner, with Michael Turner receiving reasonable parenting time as appropriate given his physical condition and the best interests of Emily Turner. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704, 711 (1985).  
17. The requested modification will ensure Emily’s welfare, safety, emotional well-being, and continuity of care while respecting the Defendant’s parenting time to the extent that it does not endanger the child or place undue responsibility upon her. See Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177, 183 (2006); Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404 (1981).  

---

### **VI. LEGAL BASIS FOR MODIFICATION**  

18. Massachusetts law requires that custody modifications serve the best interests of the child above all else. See Dusoe v. Johnson, 69 Mass. App. Ct. 13, 17 (2007).  
19. The Plaintiff asserts that the current custody arrangement no longer promotes Emily’s best interests due to her father’s medical condition and the resulting stresses and risks. See Custody of a Minor, 392 Mass. 728, 735 (1984).  
20. The Plaintiff emphasizes this Court’s longstanding recognition that stability, physical safety, and emotional well-being are paramount in any custody arrangement. See Demarco v. Demarco, 89 Mass. App. Ct. 263, 266-67 (2016); Gilmore v. Gilmore, 369 Mass. 598, 605-06 (1976).

### **VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Turner, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

A. Modify the May 15, 2018 custody order to award primary physical custody of Emily Turner to the Plaintiff;  
B. Establish a parenting time schedule for the Defendant, Michael Turner, that is compatible with his medical needs and ensures the safety and well-being of Emily Turner;  
C. Grant such other relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

Respectfully submitted,  
DATED: December 1, 2025  

**Plaintiff, Jessica Turner**
