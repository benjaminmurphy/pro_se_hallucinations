### **STATEMENT OF FACTS**

6. On or about August 15, 2023, at approximately 8:30 a.m., Plaintiff, Alex Johnson, was riding his bicycle to work on Boylston Street in Boston, Massachusetts.

7. Plaintiff was traveling in a designated and clearly marked bike lane near 500 Boylston Street, wearing appropriate safety gear, including a helmet, and otherwise riding in compliance with Massachusetts traffic laws.

8. At the same time, Defendant was parked in a loading zone adjacent to the bike lane.

9. Without looking or checking for cyclists, Defendant suddenly opened the driver-side door of his vehicle directly into the bike lane and into Plaintiff’s path.

10. Plaintiff had no warning, time, or ability to avoid the door, and he collided with the edge of the door, was thrown from his bicycle, and landed on the pavement.

11. Defendant admitted at the time of the incident that he “didn’t see” Plaintiff and was looking at his phone.

12. As a result of the collision, Plaintiff suffered physical injuries, including road rash on his arms and legs, a chipped front tooth, and emotional distress. Plaintiff also incurred damage to his bicycle, requiring its replacement.

13. Plaintiff incurred medical expenses in the amount of $1,200.00 and lost approximately $800.00 in wages due to time missed from work. Plaintiff also acquired other incidental damages.  

14. Defendant’s subsequent claim to his insurance provider that Plaintiff was “weaving in and out of traffic” is false; Plaintiff was riding lawfully and within the designated bike lane.

15. The collision and resultant injuries were directly and proximately caused by Defendant’s failure to exercise reasonable care regarding the operation of his vehicle and opening of his door, in violation of Massachusetts law.

### **CAUSE OF ACTION – NEGLIGENCE**

16. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully restated herein.  

17. Under Massachusetts law, drivers owe a duty of care to all road users, including cyclists, to operate their vehicles safely and in reasonable compliance with applicable rules of the road. *G.L. c. 90, § 14*.  

18. Specifically, under *G.L. c. 90, § 14*, drivers are prohibited from opening vehicle doors unless it is safe to do so and must exercise due caution to avoid collisions.

19. Defendant breached this duty by carelessly and negligently opening his vehicle door without first ensuring that it was safe to do so, directly endangering cyclists lawfully traveling within the adjacent bike lane.

20. Defendant’s negligent and unlawful conduct constitutes a violation of *G.L. c. 85, § 11B(2)(iii)*, which provides cyclists with the right to use designated bike lanes free from unreasonable obstruction.  

21. Defendant was further negligent by focusing on his phone rather than taking reasonable precautions to ensure safety prior to opening his door. Massachusetts courts have consistently held that a driver’s failure to act with reasonable care constitutes actionable negligence. See *Pokora v. Wabash Ry. Co.*, 292 U.S. 98 (1934); *Ulwick v. DeChristopher*, 411 Mass. 401 (1991).  

22. Defendant’s failure to check for oncoming cyclists also violates the standard of care applicable to motor vehicle operators established in *Toubiana v. Priestly*, 402 Mass. 84 (1988), where the court held that failure to address foreseeable harm to others constitutes actionable negligence.

23. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered physical injuries, monetary losses, and emotional harm. Massachusetts courts have recognized such recoverable damages in similar circumstances. See *Shantigar Found. v. Bear Mt. Builders*, 441 Mass. 131 (2004); *Ward v. Levy*, 27 Mass. App. Ct. 156 (1989).  

24. Defendant’s negligence was the sole, substantial, and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s damages as described herein.

### **DAMAGES**

25. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered:  
   a. Physical injuries including road rash, a chipped tooth, and other harm to his person;  
   b. Medical expenses totaling approximately $1,200.00;  
   c. Lost wages in the amount of approximately $800.00;  
   d. Damage to property, including Plaintiff’s bicycle;  
   e. Emotional distress; and  
   f. Other incidental losses.

26. Plaintiff’s damages are ongoing, and Plaintiff reserves the right to amend this Complaint to include additional damages as they become known.

### **PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in his favor as follows:  

1. Award Plaintiff compensatory damages, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages, property damage, and emotional distress;  
2. Award Plaintiff the costs of this action, including interest and reasonable attorney fees pursuant to applicable law;
