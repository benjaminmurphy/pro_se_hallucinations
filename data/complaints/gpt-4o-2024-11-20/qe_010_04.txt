**Jessica Moore**  
Plaintiff,  
v.  
**Karen Thompson**  
Defendant.  

**Civil Action No. ___________**  

### VERIFIED COMPLAINT  

**INTRODUCTION**  

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Moore, brings this complaint against her landlord, Defendant Karen Thompson, for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts General Laws chapter 186, section 14, and related violations of her landlord-tenant rights.  
2. The Plaintiff has suffered significant harm, including the degradation of her living conditions and adverse health effects, due to Defendant’s failure to remedy a pervasive and harmful mold issue in the Plaintiff’s rental unit and Defendant’s refusal to address inadequate ventilation causing the mold.  

### PARTIES  

3. The Plaintiff, Jessica Moore, is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01852. She has rented an apartment at this address since June 1, 2021.  
4. The Defendant, Karen Thompson, is an individual who owns the property located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01852, and operates as the Plaintiff's landlord.  

### JURISDICTION AND VENUE  

5. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19, as the amount in controversy falls within the jurisdictional limits of the District Court.  
6. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1, because the events giving rise to this complaint occurred in Lowell, Massachusetts.  

### FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

7. The Plaintiff entered into a written lease agreement with the Defendant beginning on or about June 1, 2021, for an apartment located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts.  
8. The Plaintiff continues to rent the apartment and pays $1,200 per month in rent.  
9. The apartment’s bathroom has no external window and relies solely on an exhaust fan for ventilation.  
10. In or around September 2025, the Plaintiff observed mold growth in the corner of the shower in the bathroom and reported it promptly to the Defendant.  
11. The mold has progressively spread to the ceiling of the bathroom and has rendered the bathroom unsafe and unsanitary.  
12. The Plaintiff’s personal property, including a shower curtain and towels, has been damaged due to mold contamination, causing a loss of approximately $60.  
13. The Plaintiff has experienced respiratory issues, including coughing, congestion, and wheezing, which her physician attributes to the presence of mold in her living environment.  
14. The Defendant inspected the bathroom only to blame the Plaintiff for the mold, stating that the Plaintiff allegedly did not use the exhaust fan sufficiently and that her hot showers caused the mold.  
15. Despite being notified of the health and safety concerns, the Defendant has failed to address the underlying cause of the mold, namely the inadequate ventilation of the bathroom.  
16. The Defendant has offered to clean the existing mold but refuses to implement measures necessary to prevent its recurrence, in direct violation of her statutory and contractual obligations under Massachusetts law.  

### CAUSES OF ACTION  

**COUNT I: BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT**  

17. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully stated herein.  
18. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, every residential lease in Massachusetts includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, which prohibits a landlord from interfering with a tenant’s use and enjoyment of the rental property.  
19. The pervasive mold in the Plaintiff’s apartment has materially interfered with her right to use and enjoy the premises and has jeopardized her health and safety.  
20. Defendant’s refusal to adequately remedy the mold problem and its underlying causes constitutes a violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  
21. Massachusetts law provides that a landlord is strictly liable for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment where the landlord’s actions or omissions substantially interfere with a tenant’s living conditions.  

**AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT**  

22. Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, a tenant may recover actual and consequential damages for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  
23. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has held that “[i]nterference with a tenant’s rights need not be willful for a landlord to breach the covenant of quiet enjoyment.” *Castenholz v. Caira*, 21 Mass. App. Ct. 758, 763 (1986).  
24. Landlords are responsible for repairing and maintaining rental units to ensure habitable conditions and compliance with the state sanitary code. See G.L. c. 111, § 127L; *Berman & Sons, Inc. v. Jefferson*, 379 Mass. 196, 199 (1979).  
25. The presence of mold, which poses a health risk, has been held to constitute a violation of health, safety, and sanitary standards under Massachusetts law. See *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, 410 Mass. 855, 873-74 (1991).  
26. The Massachusetts sanitary code, 105 CMR 410.000 et seq., requires landlords to ensure that bathrooms are adequately ventilated to prevent the type of moisture buildup that fosters mold growth. See *Young v. Patukonis*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1987).  
27. Defendant’s failure to adequately address and remediate the mold in Plaintiff’s rental unit, despite being on notice, is a breach of her statutory obligations.  
28. The Plaintiff has a right to recover damages for the mold’s interference with her enjoyment of the leased premises, including actual damages, emotional distress, and personal property damage. *College Hill Properties, LLC v. Fiorentino*, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 378, 383-84 (2016).  
29. Emotional distress and health-related injuries caused by a landlord’s breach are compensable in actions for breach of quiet enjoyment. *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 101 (1982).  

### PRAYER FOR RELIEF  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Moore respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:  
1. An award of actual damages for Plaintiff’s property losses in the amount of $60.  
2. An award of consequential damages, including compensation for Plaintiff’s respiratory health issues, emotional distress, and interference with the use of the premises, in the amount of $190.  
3. The costs of this action, including statutory interest and reasonable attorney’s fees, pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14.  
4. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.
