### **IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

7. At all relevant times, Defendant Thomas Roberts was the owner and occupier of the property located at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, Massachusetts, 01201.

8. Upon information and belief, a large maple tree with branches extending over the public sidewalk in front of Defendant’s property was in a visibly hazardous condition for a significant period prior to the incident that caused Plaintiff’s injuries.  

9. Specifically, neighbors and the Plaintiff herself noted that one of the large branches of the tree was cracked, drooping, and visibly at risk of falling.  

10. Neighbors informed Thomas Roberts of the dangerous condition of the tree branch on multiple occasions and recommended that he consult a licensed arborist to address the issue.  

11. Defendant acknowledged the dangerous condition but failed to act, stating that he would address the issue at a later date.  

12. On July 15, 2023, at approximately 4:00 PM, as Plaintiff Emily Johnson was walking past Defendant’s property on the public sidewalk with grocery bags, the cracked and drooping branch broke and fell, striking Plaintiff on the shoulder and back and forcibly knocking her to the ground.  

13. The incident occurred during a typical summer thunderstorm with moderate wind and rain, conditions that would not be considered extreme or unforeseeable.  

14. As a direct result of the branch striking her, Plaintiff suffered a shoulder strain, extensive bruising on her back and shoulder, and significant pain and discomfort.  

15. Plaintiff was treated for her injuries at Berkshire Medical Center, where she incurred $2,500 in medical expenses.  

16. Plaintiff was unable to work for one week as a result of her injuries, resulting in $600 of lost wages from her retail job.  

17. Plaintiff continues to experience lingering pain, emotional distress, and diminished quality of life due to the injuries caused by Defendant’s negligence.

### **V. COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE**

18. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  

19. Defendant owed a duty of care to members of the public, including Plaintiff, to maintain his property, including trees on his property, in a condition that would not unreasonably endanger others. (See *Perry v. Medeiros*, 369 Mass. 836, 839 (1976) (landowners have a duty to exercise reasonable care to protect lawful visitors and others from hazards on their property)).  

20. Defendant breached this duty by failing to inspect, maintain, and remove hazardous portions of the tree located on his property despite clear signs that it posed a risk to passersby. (*Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368, 378 (2010) (landowners must take reasonable steps to address known risks)).  

21. Defendant knew or reasonably should have known about the hazardous condition of the tree branch, given its visible deterioration and repeated warnings from neighbors. (*Pridgen v. Boston Hous. Auth.*, 364 Mass. 696, 709 (1974) (a landowner's duty includes remedying known hazards)).  

22. Defendant’s failure to address the dangerous condition of the tree constituted a foreseeable risk of harm to pedestrians like Plaintiff. (*Bernier v. Boston Edison Co.*, 380 Mass. 372, 379 (1980) (a defendant is liable for foreseeable harm resulting from their negligence)).  

23. Defendant’s negligent maintenance of his property was the direct and proximate cause of the injuries sustained by Plaintiff. (*Berger v. Boston Sand & Gravel Co.*, 292 Mass. 356, 366 (1935) (liability for negligence requires proof of causation between breach and injuries)).  

24. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered physical injuries, pain and suffering, medical expenses, lost wages, and emotional distress. (*Rodrigues v. Elizondo*, 486 Mass. 724, 728 (2021) (allowing recovery for all damages caused by negligence)).  

25. Defendant, as a property owner, is liable for Plaintiff's injuries under Massachusetts law. (*Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 708 (1973) (rejecting distinctions between invitees and licensees for purposes of landowners' duty of care)).
