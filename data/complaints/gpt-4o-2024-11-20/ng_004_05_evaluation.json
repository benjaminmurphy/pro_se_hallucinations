      "support_reasoning": "The court expressly states that a property owner owes a duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors to maintain the property in a reasonably safe condition, and it abolishes any special limitation for snow and ice. While the facts involve a parking lot rather than a public sidewalk, the opinion broadly reaffirms the general premises-liability duty under both common law and in light of existing regulations requiring means of access and egress (which include walkways) to be kept free of snow and ice. Thus, it supports the general proposition that a defendant owes a duty of reasonable care to lawful persons on abutting walking areas to maintain the premises safely.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "We now will apply to hazards arising from snow and ice the same obligation that a property owner owes to lawful visitors as to all other hazards: a duty to \u201cact as a reasonable person under all of the circumstances including the likelihood of injury to others, the probable seriousness of such injuries, and the burden of reducing or avoiding the risk.\u201d \u2026 If a property owner knows or reasonably should know of a dangerous condition on its property, whether arising from an accumulation of snow or ice\u2026 the property owner owes a duty to lawful visitors to make reasonable efforts to protect lawful visitors against the danger."

It does not address premises liability, sidewalk conditions, duties owed to pedestrians, or any obligations of landlords or abutters to address foreseeable dangers on sidewalks. Therefore it does not support the stated proposition about Massachusetts law on sidewalk-related duties of landowners or those in control of abutting premises.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe only question argued relates to the obligation imposed upon the defendants by their voluntary transfer of the good will of the restaurant and liquor business. \u2026 It is settled in this Commonwealth that when a man voluntarily sells the good will of his business he thereby precludes himself from setting up a competing business which will derogate from the good will which he has sold.\u201d"

Southworth concerns attorneys\u2019 fees in civil rights litigation and the standards for setting reasonable fee awards under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. It does not discuss Massachusetts tort law, premises liability, sidewalks, or any duty owed by landlords or property owners to pedestrians. Therefore, it does not provide authority for the claimed proposition about obligations of those controlling premises abutting sidewalks.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "As we said in King, the assessment of a reasonable fee in a particular case rests within the sound discretion of the district court. 560 F.2d at 1026, citing Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., 488 F.2d 714, 717 (5th Cir. 1974). This means that we will look for a reasoned discussion of those factors that the court finds relevant."

      "support_reasoning": "The opinion squarely rejects the idea that the defendant had actual (or constructive) notice of the icy condition. The court holds that there was insufficient evidence to infer the defendant knew or should have known of the ice, expressly finding the cook\u2019s comment about it being \u201calways a mess back there\u201d too vague to establish notice. Thus, the case is authority against, not in favor of, the proposition that defendant had actual notice and an opportunity to remedy the hazard but failed to act.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cAfter reviewing the evidence presented at the first trial, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict should have been allowed\u2026 Specifically, we hold that the evidence did not warrant an inference that the defendant knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, of the icy condition that caused the plaintiff\u2019s fall\u2026 Contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s suggestion, the cook\u2019s statement\u2026 does not provide support for an inference that the defendant violated its duty to the plaintiff.\u201d"

      "support_confidence": "medium",
      "support_reasoning": "The opinion deals with negligent snow and ice clearance and whether an artificial accumulation was allowed to persist, but it does not squarely address the specific foreseeability concept that melted and refrozen snow would create ice dangerous to pedestrians. The evidence referenced involves plowing, sanding, ruts, and powdery snow over \u2018muddy ice,\u2019 with melting temperatures on prior days, yet the court does not articulate a rule about the defendant knowing or having reason to know that melt-and-refreeze would pose a danger. Thus, the case is about negligent maintenance of snow/ice rather than the particular proposition stated.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe plaintiff\u2019s testimony to a condition like \u2018muddy ice,\u2019 with ruts three and four inches deep, covered and obscured by a half inch of snow, was reinforced by the meteorologist\u2019s testimony about snowfall consistent with such a condition. The jury could infer that the clearing was negligently done and that the resulting condition was negligently allowed to continue for several days. Lanagan v. Jordan Marsh Co. 324 Mass. 540, 541-542.

      "support_confidence": "high",
      "support_reasoning": "The excerpt is a concurring opinion discussing the proper framework for occupiers\u2019 liability, specifically criticizing the continued use of status categories like trespasser, licensee, and invitee. It does not address causation, slipping and falling, or resulting physical or economic injuries, nor does it make any finding that a defendant\u2019s breach directly caused a plaintiff\u2019s fall and losses. Therefore, this citation does not support the specific proposition about breach, causation, and damages from a slip-and-fall incident.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "The court holds that the measure of responsibility of an occupier should no longer depend on whether the injured person is characterized as a \u201clicensee\u201d rather than an \u201cinvitee,\u201d or vice versa; the question is to turn on other, more vital factors. But footnote 7 seems to say that \u201ctrespassers\u201d stand apart, that that characterization is to remain decisive or highly influential."
