**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**LOWELL DISTRICT COURT**  

**Jessica Thompson**  
**Plaintiff**  
v.  
**Karen Reynolds**  
**Defendant**  

**Civil Action**  
No. __________  

**COMPLAINT**  

**PARTIES**  

1. Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, is an individual residing at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01851.  
2. Defendant, Karen Reynolds, is an individual and the owner and landlord of the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01851.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

3. This Court has jurisdiction under G.L. c. 218, § 19 as the damages sought do not exceed $50,000, and venue is proper under G.L. c. 223, § 1 because the property at issue is located in Lowell, Massachusetts.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

4. Plaintiff is a tenant of 123 Maple Street, Lowell, Massachusetts, pursuant to a written lease agreement dated May 1, 2022.  
5. Plaintiff pays $1,200 per month in rent to Defendant.  
6. Since mid-2023, mold has been growing in the bathroom of the subject premises, spreading from the corner of the shower to the ceiling.  
7. Plaintiff informed Defendant about the mold, and Defendant inspected the bathroom but refused to address the underlying ventilation issues, instead blaming Plaintiff for the mold’s growth.  
8. The bathroom in the subject premises is not equipped with a window, only an exhaust fan, and Plaintiff has reasonably used the exhaust fan during showers.  
9. Since the growth of the mold, Plaintiff has experienced respiratory symptoms, including coughing, congestion, and wheezing, which a licensed medical professional has opined are related to the presence of mold.  
10. Plaintiff had to discard mold-damaged property, including a shower curtain and towels, incurring out-of-pocket losses of approximately $60.  
11. Defendant’s refusal to remedy the mold issue and address the inadequate ventilation interferes with Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment of the premises.  
12. Despite Plaintiff’s repeated complaints, Defendant’s failure to act has caused Plaintiff ongoing harm, including physical health issues and property damage.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  

**Count I** Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

13. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.  
14. Under G.L. c. 186, § 14, Defendant, as a landlord, is prohibited from interfering with the tenant’s right to quiet enjoyment.  
15. The mold, caused by ventilation issues in the bathroom that Defendant failed to remedy, constitutes a serious and unreasonable interference with Plaintiff’s right to use and enjoy the premises.  
16. Defendant’s blame-shifting and refusal to appropriately address the conditions, despite notice from Plaintiff, constitutes a constructive eviction and an actionable violation of Massachusetts law.  
17. Plaintiff has suffered damages, including harm to her health, property loss, and emotional distress, as a result of Defendant’s actions and omissions.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court grant the following relief:  

1. Find that Defendant has violated the covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, § 14.  
2. Award Plaintiff monetary damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but no less than $200 including the cost of replacement property and damages to her right of quiet enjoyment of the premises.  
3. Award Plaintiff reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, as provided under G.L. c. 186, § 14.  
4. Any other relief this Court deems just and proper.  

**JURY DEMAND**  

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

**SIGNATURE BLOCK**  

Respectfully submitted,  

DATED: December 1, 2025
