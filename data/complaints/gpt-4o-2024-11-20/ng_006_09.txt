**Commonwealth of Massachusetts  
Suffolk Superior Court  
Civil Action No.: [To Be Assigned]**

**Michael Thompson,**  
Plaintiff  

v.  

**Jason Reynolds,**  
Defendant  

**COMPLAINT**  

**INTRODUCTION**  
1. This is a personal injury action seeking damages for injuries sustained by Plaintiff, Michael Thompson, as a direct result of Defendant, Jason Reynolds’ negligence.  

2. On May 15, 2023, Defendant opened his vehicle’s door into a marked bike lane without first checking for approaching bicyclists, causing Plaintiff, who was lawfully riding in said bike lane, to crash into the vehicle door, suffering personal injuries and property damage. Defendant’s negligent actions were the proximate cause of Plaintiff's injuries, economic losses, and physical and emotional suffering.  

**PARTIES**  
3. Plaintiff, Michael Thompson, is an individual residing in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.  

4. Defendant, Jason Reynolds, upon information and belief, is an individual residing in Massachusetts. At all times relevant to the Complaint, Defendant was the driver and/or occupant of a vehicle located at or near 123 Elm St., Boston, MA 02108.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
5. Jurisdiction is proper in this matter pursuant to M.G.L. c. 212 § 4 because the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000 and Plaintiff seeks recovery for personal injuries.  

6. Venue is proper in the Suffolk Superior Court pursuant to M.G.L. c. 223 § 1 because the conduct giving rise to this claim occurred in Suffolk County, Massachusetts.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
7. On May 15, 2023, Plaintiff was bicycling to work in Boston, Massachusetts, in a marked bike lane on Elm Street, in compliance with all applicable traffic laws and safety regulations.  

8. At approximately 7:45 AM, Defendant was legally parked in a designated loading zone adjacent to the bike lane at or near 123 Elm St., Boston, MA.  

9. Without warning and without checking for oncoming bicyclists in the bike lane, Defendant suddenly opened his vehicle’s door into the bike lane as Plaintiff was lawfully passing.  

10. As a direct consequence, Plaintiff collided with the open door. The impact caused him to be thrown from his bike, striking the pavement, and sustaining significant physical injuries and damage to his bicycle.  

11. At the scene, Defendant acknowledged his fault, admitting that he "didn't see" Plaintiff because he had been distracted by his phone.  

12. As a result of the collision, Plaintiff sustained the following injuries and damages:  
   a. Physical injuries, including road rash on his arms and legs and a chipped front tooth;  
   b. Emotional distress and pain and suffering resulting from the injuries and the traumatic nature of the collision;  
   c. Medical expenses totaling approximately $2,500 for dental treatment and related care;  
   d. Lost wages of approximately $800 due to missed work while recovering from injuries; and  
   e. Damage to Plaintiff’s bicycle, including a bent frame and additional damage requiring the purchase of a replacement.  

13. Defendant’s conduct violated the duty of care owed to Plaintiff as a bicyclist lawfully using the roadways of Massachusetts.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**Count I – Negligence**  
14. Plaintiff restates and realleges all prior paragraphs as though fully stated herein.  

15. Under Massachusetts law, Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of care to operate and use his vehicle, including its doors, in a reasonably safe manner so as not to endanger other road users, including bicyclists. (See G.L. c. 89, § 2; G.L. c. 90, §§ 14, 17.)  

16. Defendant breached his duty of care by negligently opening his vehicle’s door into a marked bike lane without first ensuring it was safe to do so, in violation of G.L. c. 90, § 14, which requires vehicle operators to check for traffic before opening a door.  

17. Defendant’s actions were also in violation of Massachusetts’ “dooring law,” which is designed to prevent precisely this type of collision (G.L. c. 90, § 14).  

18. Defendant’s negligent conduct caused Plaintiff to suffer significant injuries, financial losses, and emotional distress.  

19. But for Defendant’s negligent opening of his vehicle door, Plaintiff would not have collided with the door, would not have been thrown from his bicycle, and would not have sustained damages.  

20. Defendant’s negligence was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries and damages.  

**Caselaw Supporting the Negligence Claim**  
21. Massachusetts courts consistently hold that drivers owe a duty of care to bicyclists, including the duty to exercise reasonable caution before opening vehicle doors. *See Commonwealth v. Kaplan*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 726 (1987).  

22. The principle of negligence requires compliance with safety-related statutes, the violation of which constitutes evidence of negligence. *See Bennett v. Eagle Brook Country Store, Inc.*, 408 Mass. 355, 360 (1990).  

23. The Massachusetts “dooring law” codified in G.L. c. 90, § 14 protects bicyclists from harm and imposes a duty on vehicle occupants to ensure safety before opening doors. *See Brodeur v. Desrosiers*, 505 F.3d 53, 60 (1st Cir. 2007).  

24. Courts have also recognized that the foreseeability of harm is central to negligence claims, and conduct that endangers lawful bicyclists is foreseeably harmful. *See Poskus v. Lombardo’s of Randolph, Inc.*, 423 Mass. 637 (1996).  

25. Defendant’s failure to abide by these statutory and common law duties directly resulted in harm to Plaintiff, satisfying the elements of a negligence cause of action under Massachusetts law.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Michael Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in his favor and award the following relief:  
   a. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial but exceeding $50,000 for medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, emotional distress, and property damage;  
   b. Prejudgment interest as provided by law;  
   c. Post-judgment interest as provided by law;  
   d. Attorneys' fees and costs to the extent permitted by law; and  
   e. Any other relief the Court deems just and proper.  

**DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL**  
Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,  

Dated: December 1, 2025
