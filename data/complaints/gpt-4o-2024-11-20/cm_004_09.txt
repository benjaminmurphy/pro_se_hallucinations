**BRISTOL PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT**  
**DOCKET NO. [Insert Existing Case Number]**

_________________________________________  
**LISA THOMPSON,**  
   Plaintiff,  
                                v.  
**MARK JOHNSON,**

_________________________________________

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

**NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Lisa Thompson, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody order entered on April 15, 2018, concerning the parties’ minor child, Ethan Johnson. In support of this Complaint, the Plaintiff states the following:**

---

### **I. PARTIES**  

**1. Plaintiff** Lisa Thompson resides at [Insert Address], in the County of Bristol, Commonwealth of Massachusetts. She is the mother and custodial parent of the minor child, Ethan Johnson, born [Insert Date of Birth].  

**2. Defendant** Mark Johnson resides at [Insert Address], in the County of Bristol, Commonwealth of Massachusetts. He is the father and non-custodial parent of the minor child, Ethan Johnson.

---

### **II. JURISDICTION**  

**3.** This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 209C, § 20, as this Honorable Court issued the original custody order dated April 15, 2018.  

**4.** Venue is proper in Bristol Probate and Family Court under Massachusetts law, as both parties reside in Bristol County and the minor child resides in Massachusetts.  

---

### **III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**  

**5.** On April 15, 2018, this Court issued a custody order granting the Plaintiff, Lisa Thompson, primary physical custody of the parties’ minor child, Ethan Johnson. The Defendant, Mark Johnson, was awarded three weekday visits and Sunday afternoon visits without overnight visitation.  

**6.** At the time the original order was entered, the Defendant resided in a shared apartment with roommates and had no private space suitable for overnight visitation for the minor child.  

**7.** The minor child, Ethan Johnson, is now eight years old and attends school full time. His schedule and needs have significantly changed since the original order was entered.  

**8.** Plaintiff and Defendant have communicated regarding the minor child’s best interests, and both parents recognize that the current schedule—consisting of short, frequent visits during the week—has become disruptive to the child’s homework, bedtime routine, and general well-being.

**9.** Plaintiff has observed that the schedule causes the child to experience unnecessary exhaustion due to frequent transitions between homes, particularly on school nights. The current arrangement does not reflect the child’s developmental needs and priorities as a school-age child.  

**10.** The Defendant has since secured stable, appropriate housing, including a private bedroom for the minor child at his residence. This change in circumstances would allow the minor child to benefit from overnight visitation without risk to his well-being.  

**11.** The minor child has repeatedly expressed a desire for increased time, including overnight visitation, with the Defendant.

**12.** It is in the minor child’s best interests to modify the current custody order to establish a less disruptive visitation schedule and to allow for overnight visitation.

---

### **IV. MATERIAL CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES**  

**13.** Since the entry of the original custody order in 2018, there have been significant and material changes in circumstances, including but not limited to:  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. The minor child, who was three years old at the time of the original order, is now eight years old and enrolled in school full time;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. The Defendant has secured stable and appropriate housing, including a private bedroom for the child, which was unavailable at the time of the original order; and  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. The current visitation schedule has become disruptive to the child’s routine, including school responsibilities, homework, and sleep.  

**14.** The material changes in circumstances require this Honorable Court to review and modify the existing custody order in accordance with the best interests of the minor child, as set forth in G.L. c. 208, § 28.  

---

### **V. REQUEST FOR MODIFICATION**  

**15.** Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify its prior custody order as follows:  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Establish a visitation schedule that reduces midweek disruptions to accommodate the child’s school and bedtime routine; and  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Allow for overnight visitation between the minor child and the Defendant at his residence, where the child now has a suitable, private bedroom.  

**16.** Plaintiff proposes an updated schedule that includes regular, predictable overnight visits for the Defendant, in a manner consistent with the minor child’s educational and emotional needs.  

---

### **VI. LEGAL BASIS**  

**17.** Under Massachusetts law, a custody order may be modified upon a showing of a material change in circumstances and a determination that the modification would be in the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; G.L. c. 209C, § 20.  

**18.** The material changes outlined in this Complaint warrant modification of the April 15, 2018, order in accordance with the child’s current needs and circumstances. See Ardizoni v. Raymond, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734 (1996) (“The overriding principle in determining modification of custody is the best interests of the child.”).  

**19.** In making custody determinations, Massachusetts courts consider factors such as the child’s physical, psychological, and emotional development. See Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177 (2006).  

**20.** Massachusetts case law establishes that stability, continuity, and a child’s expressed preferences are key considerations in determining child custody arrangements. See Middleton v. Middleton, 69 Mass. App. Ct. 1109 (2007); Gilmore v. Gilmore, 369 Mass. 598 (1976).  

**21.** Courts also recognize that a parent’s improved living conditions may constitute a material change warranting modification. See Pizzino v. Miller, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006).  

**22.** A visitation schedule that interferes with a child’s education or disrupts a child’s daily routine is not in the child’s best interests. See D.A. v. T.R., 73 Mass. App. Ct. 141 (2008).  

**23.** The proposed modification adheres to the principles established in Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985), by supporting the minor child’s best interests and ensuring his welfare and stability.  

---

### **VII. RELIEF REQUESTED**  

**WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:**  
1. Find that there has been a material change in circumstances since the April 15, 2018, custody order;  
2. Modify the existing custody order to establish a schedule that reflects the minor child’s age, school schedule, and expressed preferences;  
3. Grant the Defendant parenting time that includes overnight visitation; and  
4. Grant such other relief as this Court deems just and proper.
