**III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

5. The Plaintiff and the Defendant entered into a residential lease agreement commencing on May 1, 2022, under which the Plaintiff rents the apartment at 456 Green Street in exchange for monthly rent of $1,200.  
6. Plaintiff has complied with all relevant terms of her lease agreement, including the timely payment of rent.  
7. Beginning in approximately September 2025, the Plaintiff started noticing frequent and pervasive mouse droppings in her kitchen.  
8. Plaintiff promptly notified the Defendant of the issue, and Defendant initially responded by placing a small number of mouse traps in the apartment. These traps caught only a small number of mice.  
9. Despite these efforts, the infestation of mice persisted, and Plaintiff continued to regularly find mouse droppings in her kitchen.  
10. The Defendant hired an exterminator for a single visit. However, the exterminator informed the Plaintiff that the building likely required more comprehensive treatment to adequately address the infestation.  
11. The Defendant declined to perform further treatment, asserting that such measures were unnecessary and too expensive.  
12. In response to the mouse infestation, Plaintiff was forced to throw away approximately $200 worth of contaminated food and purchase plastic containers to safeguard her remaining food, incurring an additional out-of-pocket expense of approximately $80.  
13. The persistent mouse infestation has caused the Plaintiff significant distress, anxiety, and inconvenience, interfering with her ability to use and enjoy her home as intended.  
14. Despite the Plaintiff’s repeated complaints, the Defendant has failed to take reasonable measures to remediate the infestation, asserting instead that the presence of mice is "normal for older buildings" and implying that the issue resulted from the Plaintiff’s housekeeping habits.  
15. Defendant’s failure to meaningfully address the infestation constitutes a breach of the landlord’s duty to ensure that the premises are fit to be occupied and free from conditions that interfere with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment.

**IV. CAUSE OF ACTION:** **Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  

16. The Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein.  
17. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is expressly recognized under Massachusetts law, codified at G.L. c. 186, § 14, and guarantees that tenants of residential properties shall be free from substantial interference with the use and enjoyment of their leased premises.  
18. Massachusetts law imposes an affirmative duty on landlords to maintain residential rental properties in habitable condition and in compliance with applicable sanitary codes. See G.L. c. 239, § 8A; Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184 (1973).  
19. A persistent mouse infestation constitutes a violation of the State Sanitary Code, 105 CMR 410.550(A), which requires that premises be kept free from rodent infestation.  
20. The Defendant’s failure to remedy the mouse infestation and his refusal to implement reasonable measures recommended by an exterminator constitute substantial breaches of the Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment.  
21. Under Massachusetts law, a landlord’s failure to abate a serious defect after receiving notice interferes with a tenant’s legally protected interest in the enjoyment and use of the premises. See G.L. c. 186, § 14; Berman v. Curry, 58 Mass. App. Ct. 84, 88 (2003).  
22. A landlord's failure to maintain the premises in habitable condition, including addressing a rodent infestation, constitutes a violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth., 417 Mass. 273, 285 (1994); Blackett v. Olanoff, 371 Mass. 714, 720 (1977).  
23. Defendant’s actions and inactions have caused Plaintiff financial harm, emotional distress, and substantial interference with her ability to use her home for the purpose for which it was rented.  
24. As provided by G.L. c. 186, § 14, a tenant may recover actual and consequential damages, plus attorneys’ fees, for breaches of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  
25. The Plaintiff has incurred actual damages of at least $280.

**V. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  
1. Enter judgment in her favor on the above-stated claim;  
2. Award her actual damages in the amount of $280, or such other amount as the Court deems proper;  
3. Award her additional damages, including consequential and statutory damages, as allowed under G.L. c. 186, § 14;  
4. Order such other relief as the Court deems just and equitable.  

Respectfully submitted,
