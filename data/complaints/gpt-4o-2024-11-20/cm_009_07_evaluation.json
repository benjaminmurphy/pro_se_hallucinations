The opinion also ties joint custody and relocation decisions to promoting the children\u2019s welfare and development, demonstrating that the children\u2019s physical, educational, and emotional well-being are paramount in determining whether a parenting arrangement (including relocation) will be approved. Although the case is about relocation with joint custody, the articulated standard directly reflects that the child\u2019s well-being is the controlling consideration in custody/parenting schedule decisions.",

Those are routine, educational, and stability-related considerations folded into the best\u2011interests analysis. However, the case is more directly about domestic violence than about defining best\u2011interests generally, so its support is indirect rather than explicit.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "The judge was also moved by the fact that the boy appeared to be doing very well in his school work and that the father takes a great interest in his activities, meeting regularly with the boy\u2019s teachers. Finally, the Probate Court judge noted that the father, who had been a heavy drinker, had not used alcohol since 1985 and attends weekly sessions of Alcoholics Anonymous. The court also mandated that both parents should remain in therapy.\n...\nAs almost three years have gone by since the Probate Court issued its judgment and Vaughn is now almost fourteen years of age, it may be appropriate for the judge to interview the child again as to his preference and for the judge to evaluate the success of the stipulated custody arrangement the parties have been living under in the interim."

L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 (a), again respecting and not disturbing the mother's decision to relocate. ... Stability is itself of enormous benefit to a child, and any unnecessary tampering with the status quo simply increases the risk of harm to the child.\""
