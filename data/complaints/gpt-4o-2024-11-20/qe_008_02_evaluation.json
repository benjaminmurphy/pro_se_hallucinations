The excerpt expressly disagrees with the majority\u2019s broader implied warranty approach and instead would limit the landlord\u2019s implied obligations to compliance with housing codes; it does not discuss or establish that a covenant of quiet enjoyment is implied in every Massachusetts residential lease. Thus it does not provide authority for the specific proposition stated.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cAs the first step in the removal of the roadblock discussed above I would reverse that rule and hold instead (a) that the various statutes, ordinances, by-laws, rules, regulations and codes prescribing minimum standards for dwelling units impose on the landlord, for the benefit of his tenants, an obligation to comply with those minimum standards, and (b) that by renting such a unit the landlord impliedly agrees with his tenant (i) that at the time of the renting the unit complies with those standards and (ii) that during the term of the renting he will do whatever such legal provisions require him to do for compliance with such standards.\u201d"

This directly aligns with the idea that a breach occurs when the landlord substantially interferes with the tenant\u2019s lawful use and enjoyment of the premises through acts or omissions.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "The covenant of quiet enjoyment protects a tenant\u2019s right to freedom from serious interference with his tenancy \u2014 acts or omissions that impair the character and value of the leasehold. \u2026 [I]f the plaintiffs truly are unable to use the common areas of the development, including sidewalks, streets, parking lots, and recreation areas within it, then the situation constitutes a serious interference with their quiet enjoyment and substantially impairs the character of the leased premises."

The court does not mention locks, building security, or similar issues, nor does it tie any security-related deficiency to the covenant of quiet enjoyment. Thus, it does not provide authority for the specific proposition that security deficiencies resulting in tenant harm breach the covenant of quiet enjoyment.",

It does not discuss landlord-tenant law, duties regarding property conditions, or any obligation to address known property defects. Therefore, it cannot be cited as authority for the proposition that addressing known defects is a fundamental landlord duty.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Appellate review by this Division entails consideration of actual trial court rulings in the light of applicable law and on the basis of an established report of evidence and proceedings. Speculation as to possible trial court rulings based on unreported evidence forms no part of the appellate process.\n\nMoreover, even assuming arguendo that there was evidence at trial that the plaintiff and defendant conspired to obtain a first mortgage loan from Dime by illegal means, such illegality would not automatically render unenforceable the defendant\u2019s promissory note to the plaintiff, as both parties appear to assume."

It holds that \u00a7 14 does not require malicious intent and covers at least reckless interference with quiet enjoyment, and emphasizes that unsanitary conditions harm tenants whether the landlord acts intentionally, negligently, or innocently, thereby supporting the proposition that Massachusetts statutes protect tenants from harmful landlord conduct beyond purely intentional acts.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cSection 14 belongs to a body of statutes establishing tenants\u2019 remedies against landlords who fail to provide safe and sanitary housing\u2026 The objectives of these statutes go beyond deterrence of intentional wrongdoing; unsanitary conditions in an apartment cause harm to the occupants whether the landlord has acted intentionally, negligently, or innocently\u2026 Our analysis of the language and history of \u00a7 14\u2026 leads us to conclude that malicious intent is not necessary, and that the statute covers, at the least, reckless conduct such as Gem\u2019s.\u201d"

The opinion concerns consignee liability for freight charges under the Interstate Commerce Act and 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10744. It therefore does not address, much less establish, that failure to repair critical security measures constitutes a willful or negligent interference under G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 14.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"The sole issue in this case is whether the trial court erred in finding the defendant liable for freight charges to the plaintiff. Hallamore contends that since it was not the owner of the crane components and that it did not agree to be the consignee, it is not responsible for the payment of the tariff charges. We find no error.\""
