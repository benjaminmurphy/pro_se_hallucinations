      "support_reasoning": "The case discusses when a possessor of premises may be held liable based on actual or constructive notice of a foreign substance, but in Oliveri there was no evidence that any employee had actual knowledge of the substance before the fall. The opinion instead focuses on whether circumstantial evidence (description of the substance and timing) was sufficient to show constructive notice, and ultimately holds it was not, directing judgment for the defendant. Thus, it does not support a proposition that the defendant had actual notice via an employee\u2019s statement, nor does it find constructive notice on similar facts; it instead is largely defense\u2011favorable precedent on the insufficiency of such proof.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cWhere a foreign substance on a floor or stairway causes the business visitor to fall and sustain injuries, he may prove the negligence of the defendant by proof that the defendant or his servant caused the substance to be there, or he may show that the defendant or his servants had actual knowledge of the existence of the foreign substance\u2026 In the more usual case, however, the plaintiff attempts to establish the defendant\u2019s negligence by showing that the foreign substance was present on the defendant\u2019s premises for such a length of time that the defendant should have known about it.\u201d"
