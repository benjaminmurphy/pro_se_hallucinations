The court explains that a plaintiff must show the defendant created the condition, had actual notice, or that the condition existed long enough that the defendant should have discovered it, and ultimately reverses because the evidence did not adequately establish this notice/time element. This squarely supports a proposition about the importance of notice in negligence cases involving foreign substances on premises.",
