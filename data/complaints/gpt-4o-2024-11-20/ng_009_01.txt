**Plaintiff,**  
v.  
**ABC REALTY MANAGEMENT,**  
**Defendant.**  

**CIVIL ACTION NO. ____**

**COMPLAINT**

**PARTIES AND JURISDICTION**

1. Plaintiff Jane Doe ("Plaintiff") resides at 123 Maple Street, Third Floor, Lynn, Massachusetts.

2. Defendant ABC Realty Management ("Defendant") is a property management company organized and existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, with its primary place of business in Massachusetts.

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19, as the amount in controversy does not exceed $50,000, and venue is proper in this Court because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Lynn, Massachusetts.

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

4. Plaintiff leases an apartment on the third floor of a residential building located at 123 Maple Street, Lynn, Massachusetts, which is managed, operated, and maintained by Defendant.

5. It is Defendant's duty to maintain the common areas of the property, including hallway smoke detectors, in a safe and operable condition in compliance with G.L. c. 148, § 26B, which requires operable smoke detectors in multi-unit residential buildings.

6. For months prior to September 15, 2023, the smoke detector located in the third-floor hallway outside Plaintiff's unit was inoperative due to a missing battery.

7. The smoke detector noticeably emitted a "chirping" noise for weeks to signal a low battery, alerting Defendant to the issue.

8. Plaintiff personally notified Defendant of the issue with the smoke detector on at least three occasions, and Defendant repeatedly assured Plaintiff that the issue would be remedied.

9. Despite Defendant's assurances, no action was taken to replace the missing battery or otherwise repair the smoke detector.

10. On September 15, 2023, a fire broke out in a first-floor apartment in the building, originating in the kitchen.

11. Because the third-floor hallway smoke detector was inoperative, Plaintiff and other third-floor residents received no audible warning of the fire and were instead alerted only when smoke had already filled the hallway.

12. Plaintiff was forced to evacuate her unit through a smoke-filled hallway, experiencing significant difficulty breathing and resulting in smoke inhalation that required overnight hospitalization.

13. Plaintiff suffered economic damages as a result of the fire, including approximately $7,500 in medical expenses and approximately $2,000 in lost wages.

14. Plaintiff also suffered personal property damage due to smoke and water contamination, the cost of which is still being determined.

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**Negligence**

15. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 14.

16. Defendant had a duty to exercise reasonable care in maintaining the premises, including ensuring functioning smoke detectors as required by Massachusetts law under G.L. c. 148, § 26B and G.L. c. 143, § 3Z.

17. Defendant breached its duty of care by failing to repair or replace the battery in the inoperative third-floor hallway smoke detector, despite being repeatedly notified by Plaintiff and being aware of the defective condition.

18. Defendant's failure to maintain operational smoke detectors violated Massachusetts statutory and regulatory requirements, including 527 CMR 1.00 et seq., which establishes codes for fire safety.

19. Defendant's failure to maintain operable smoke detectors created a foreseeable risk of harm to the tenants, including Plaintiff, in the event of a fire.

20. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff suffered serious injuries in the form of smoke inhalation, economic damages including medical expenses and lost wages, and damage to her personal property.

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jane Doe respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant ABC Realty Management as follows:  

A. Awarding Plaintiff compensatory damages, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages, and property damage in an amount to be determined at trial but presently estimated at not less than $9,500;  

B. Awarding Plaintiff damages for pain and suffering as a result of Defendant's negligence;  

C. Awarding Plaintiff the costs and expenses of this litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6F if deemed applicable;  

D. Awarding Plaintiff such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

**JURY DEMAND**

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all triable issues in this matter.
