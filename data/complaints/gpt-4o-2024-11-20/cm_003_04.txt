**Docket No. [Insert Docket Number]**  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**  

**INTRODUCTION**  

Plaintiff Jennifer Smith ("Plaintiff"), the mother of Michael Johnson, hereby moves this Court for a modification of the custody order issued on May 15, 2021, by the Norfolk County Probate and Family Court. A substantial and material change in circumstances has occurred since entry of the original order, necessitating modification to ensure the safety and well-being of the minor child.

This Complaint for Modification is brought pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and other applicable authorities. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that the custody arrangement be modified to impose appropriate restrictions and/or supervision with respect to the Defendant's parenting time.

**PARTIES**  

1. **Jennifer Smith (Plaintiff):** The Plaintiff resides at [Plaintiff's Address], Norfolk County, Massachusetts. She is the mother of the minor child, Michael Johnson, born on [child’s birthdate].

2. **David Johnson (Defendant):** The Defendant resides at [Defendant's Address], Norfolk County, Massachusetts. He is the father of the minor child, Michael Johnson.

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this Complaint pursuant to G.L. c. 208, §§ 28 and 30, as the parties and the minor child reside in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Venue is proper in the Norfolk County Probate and Family Court as this is the court that issued the original custody order.

**FACTUAL BACKGROUND**  

4. On May 15, 2021, this Court issued a custody order granting the Plaintiff and Defendant shared legal custody of Michael Johnson, with primary physical custody awarded to the Plaintiff.

5. Under the original order, Michael resides with the Plaintiff most of the time and has parenting time with the Defendant on specified weekends.

6. At the time of the original order, the Court found it to be in Michael’s best interests for the parties to share legal custody due to their demonstrated ability to co-parent and the perceived stability of both parents.

7. Since the entry of the original order, there has been a material change in circumstances regarding the Defendant’s ability to ensure the safety and well-being of the minor child during his parenting time.

8. The Plaintiff became aware of troubling allegations from Michael regarding his experiences while at the Defendant's residence. Specifically, Michael has described the presence of “special drinks” at the Defendant’s home and stated that the Defendant “can’t walk straight” at times.

9. On or about [insert date of receipt], the Plaintiff received a video taken by a neighbor, showing the Defendant stumbling while attempting to assist Michael out of a car late at night.

10. Michael’s school has repeatedly contacted the Plaintiff to report that Michael appears exhausted and is frequently fatigued on Monday mornings following his weekend parenting time with the Defendant. This has negatively impacted Michael’s performance and overall experience at school.

11. Based on the foregoing, the Plaintiff has a reasonable concern that the Defendant may be engaging in behavior, including possible alcohol abuse, that impairs his ability to safely care for Michael during parenting time.

12. The substantial change in circumstances warrants modification of the existing custody order to safeguard the minor child’s health, safety, and emotional well-being.

**LEGAL BASIS FOR RELIEF**  

13. Massachusetts courts adhere to the principle that all custody determinations must be made in the best interests of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 28.  

14. A modification to a prior custody order is appropriate when a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the issuance of the order. *Prenaveau v. Prenaveau*, 81 Mass. App. Ct. 479, 486 (2012).

15. The evidence of the Defendant’s alleged alcohol consumption during parenting time constitutes a material and substantial change in circumstances impacting Michael’s safety. See *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 261 (2001) (noting the court’s authority to restrict parenting time to safeguard a child’s welfare).

16. The Court has consistently emphasized that the child’s safety and well-being are paramount when crafting or modifying custody orders. See *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488, 494 (2012); *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404 (1981).

17. This Court has the authority to order supervised parenting time or otherwise impose restrictions when there are legitimate concerns about a parent’s ability to provide a safe environment. See *C.P. v. J.M.* 52 Mass. App. Ct. 805, 810-11 (2001).

18. The allegations in this matter raise legitimate concerns regarding the Defendant’s fitness and ability to adequately care for Michael. The Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court act accordingly to protect the child’s best interests.

**REQUESTED RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jennifer Smith, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Find that a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the entry of the custody order dated May 15, 2021.  

2. Modify the existing custody order to impose conditions on the Defendant’s parenting time, including but not limited to:  
   a. Requiring supervised parenting time;  
   b. Imposing alcohol testing as a condition of parenting time;  
   c. Prohibiting the Defendant from consuming alcohol during or prior to parenting time.  

3. Grant any other relief that this Court deems just and proper.
