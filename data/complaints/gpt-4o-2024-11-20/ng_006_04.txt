### **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

7. On September 10, 2023, at approximately 8:30 a.m., Plaintiff was riding his bicycle to work along Commonwealth Avenue in Boston, Massachusetts.

8. Plaintiff was lawfully traveling in a marked bike lane and adhered to all relevant Massachusetts traffic laws, including Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 85, § 11B, which governs the rights and responsibilities of bicyclists.

9. Plaintiff was wearing a helmet and riding in a straight, predictable path in the designated bike lane adjacent to a loading zone.

10. At that time and place, Defendant was parked in the loading zone along Commonwealth Avenue while operating as a rideshare driver.

11. Without exercising reasonable care, Defendant suddenly opened the driver’s side door of his vehicle into the bike lane as Plaintiff was passing.

12. Defendant failed to check his rearview mirror or otherwise look for approaching bicyclists before opening his door.

13. Defendant’s door struck Plaintiff, causing him to be thrown from his bicycle, hit the pavement, and sustain injuries to his body and dental damage, as well as damage to his bicycle.

14. At the scene of the collision, Defendant admitted he did not see Plaintiff because he was “checking [his] phone.”

15. Defendant’s actions violated Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 90, § 14, which requires operators of motor vehicles to use caution when opening doors into traffic and prohibits opening a vehicle door unless it is safe to do so.

16. Despite Defendant’s admissions, his insurance company denied Plaintiff’s claim, relying on Defendant’s false statement that Plaintiff was “weaving in and out of traffic.”

17. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered physical injuries, emotional distress, economic losses, and property damage, including but not limited to:

    a. Road rash to his arms and legs requiring medical treatment;  
    b. A chipped front tooth requiring dental treatment;  
    c. A bent bicycle frame requiring replacement;  
    d. Approximately $1,200 in out-of-pocket medical expenses;  
    e. Approximately $600 in lost wages; and  
    f. Non-economic damages including pain, suffering, and mental anguish.

18. Defendant had a duty to exercise reasonable care in operating his vehicle, including ensuring it was safe to open the driver’s side door into a public roadway and bike lane.

19. Defendant breached this duty by opening his door without taking reasonable precautions to ensure it was safe to do so.

20. Defendant’s breach of his duty directly and proximately caused Plaintiff’s injuries and damages.

### **CAUSE OF ACTION: NEGLIGENCE**

21. Plaintiff incorporates by reference each and every preceding paragraph as though fully set forth herein.

22. Under Massachusetts law, a defendant is liable for negligence where they owe a duty of care to the plaintiff, breach that duty, and the breach proximately causes the plaintiff to suffer damages. See *Glidden v. Maglio*, 430 Mass. 694, 696 (2000).

23. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of care to act as a reasonably prudent person in the operation of his vehicle, including when opening his door into a public roadway.

24. Defendant breached this duty through negligent acts and omissions, including but not limited to:

   a. Failing to check his side and rearview mirrors before opening his door;  
   b. Failing to look for bicyclists in the adjacent bike lane;  
   c. Carelessly opening his vehicle door into Plaintiff’s immediate path; and  
   d. Operating his vehicle in violation of applicable Massachusetts statutes, including Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 90, § 14.

25. Defendant’s breach of duty directly and proximately caused Plaintiff’s injuries, damages, and losses.

26. Defendant’s conduct constitutes negligence under Massachusetts common law and relevant statutory authority, including but not limited to:

   a. *Boylan v. Everett*, 172 Mass. 453 (1899) (holding that motorists must exercise care when opening doors to avoid injury to others);  
   b. *Gillespie v. Seydell*, 332 Mass. 108, 110 (1954) (recognizing a motorist’s duty to avoid acts that endanger bicyclists);  
   c. *Giordano v. Duarte*, 397 Mass. 479, 482 (1986) (noting that violations of statutes may constitute evidence of negligence); and  
   d. *G.L. c. 90, § 14* (statutory duty related to opening vehicle doors safely).

27. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered substantial damages as described above and seeks appropriate relief from this Court.
