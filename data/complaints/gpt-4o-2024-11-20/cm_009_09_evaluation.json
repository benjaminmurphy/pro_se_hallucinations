The court interprets the removal statute\u2019s \u201cupon cause shown\u201d language to mean that removal must be in the child\u2019s best interests and emphasizes that the child\u2019s best interests remain the paramount concern, even while recognizing that the custodial parent\u2019s interests are relevant. Thus the case clearly affirms that the child\u2019s best interests are paramount in custody-related determinations.",

Hale, supra at 815), and thus the central question in this case is how these \u2018best interests\u2019 are to be determined. \u2026 Although the best interests of the children always remain the paramount concern, \u2018[b]ecause the best interests of a child are so interwoven with the well-being of the custodial parent, the determination of the child\u2019s best interest requires that the interests of the custodial parent be taken into account.\u2019\u201d}"

The court does not state a general rule that custody arrangements must reflect the current realities of the child\u2019s and parents\u2019 circumstances; instead, it emphasizes deference to the prior custody judgment and rejects using a court-imposed temporary arrangement as the basis for a permanent custody change.
