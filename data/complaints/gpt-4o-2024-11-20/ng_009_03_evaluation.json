However, if a plaintiff proves that an unsafe condition on an owner\u2019s premises exists that was reasonably foreseeable, resulting from an owner\u2019s self-service business or mode of operation, and the plaintiff slips as a result of the unsafe condition, the plaintiff will satisfy the notice requirement.\u201d"

It does not discuss smoke detectors, statutory safety-device obligations, or any statutory duty at all; its duty analysis is purely common-law negligence in a slip-and-fall context.
