**JASMINE REED,**  
Plaintiff  

v.  

**MARK THOMPSON,**  
Defendant  
______________________________________  

**COMPLAINT**  

**Introduction**  

1. Plaintiff Jasmine Reed (“Plaintiff”) brings this action against Defendant Mark Thompson (“Defendant”) for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law, codified at **Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 186, § 14**. Plaintiff seeks damages and other relief for Defendant’s failure to maintain adequate heat in Plaintiff’s rental apartment during the winter months, resulting in significant financial, health, and emotional harm.

---

**Parties and Jurisdiction**  

2. Plaintiff Jasmine Reed is an individual residing in a residential apartment at 123 Main Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124.  

3. Defendant Mark Thompson is an individual who, upon information and belief, resides in Massachusetts and owns and operates the residential rental property located at 123 Main Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124.  

4. This court has jurisdiction pursuant to **G.L. c. 185C, § 3**, as this case arises under the landlord-tenant relationship and pertains to a residential lease within Suffolk County.

**Factual Allegations**  

5. On or about January 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant to rent the property located at 123 Main Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts 02124 (the “Premises”) for $1,800 per month.  

6. Pursuant to the terms of the lease agreement and **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, Defendant, as landlord, is obligated to provide Plaintiff with quiet enjoyment of the premises, which includes maintaining heat at a safe and habitable level during winter months in accordance with the Massachusetts Sanitary Code (**105 CMR 410.201**).  

7. During the 2024-2025 winter season, Plaintiff repeatedly experienced inadequate heat in the Premises. Specifically, the heat would drop to approximately 60 degrees Fahrenheit during evening hours, a recurring issue that persisted over several months.  

8. Although Defendant sent repair personnel to address the issue on two occasions, the problem was never fully resolved. Defendant’s repair contractor acknowledged that the boiler was “old but functional” but failed to sufficiently remediate the heating deficiency.  

9. Plaintiff purchased two space heaters to maintain livable conditions during the periods of inadequate heat, which increased Plaintiff’s electricity costs by approximately $150 per month.  

10. During January 2025, Plaintiff contracted bronchitis, which her doctor attributed in part to exposure to cold indoor conditions. Plaintiff incurred medical expenses for treatment, including antibiotics, and missed three days of work due to her illness.  

11. Defendant was notified of the ongoing heating issues and the harm caused to Plaintiff, yet refused to take adequate action to ensure that the heating system functioned properly.  

12. Defendant’s conduct has caused Plaintiff financial harm, physical injury, emotional distress, and a loss of enjoyment of her home, in direct violation of Plaintiff’s statutory right to quiet enjoyment of the Premises.

**Cause of Action**  

**Count I – Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  

13. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 12 as if fully stated herein.  

14. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, every residential lease in Massachusetts includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, which prohibits landlords from interfering with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises.  

15. Defendant, through his failure to maintain adequate heat in the Premises, has interfered with Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment. See **Simon v. Solomon, 385 Mass. 91, 102 (1982)** (breach of quiet enjoyment occurs when landlord’s acts or omissions substantially interfere with the tenant’s use and enjoyment of the premises).  

16. Defendant’s failure to provide adequate heat violates the Massachusetts Sanitary Code regulation requiring landlords to maintain a minimum temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit in residential units during winter months. See **105 CMR 410.201**.  

17. Defendant’s ongoing failure to remediate the heating issues constitutes a willful or knowing violation of Plaintiff’s statutory rights under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, entitling Plaintiff to payment of actual and consequential damages, expenses, and attorneys’ fees.  

18. As a result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered damages totaling approximately $1,200, including increased utility costs, medical expenses, and emotional distress.

**Prayer for Relief**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grant the following relief:  

A. Judgment in favor of Plaintiff on her claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14**.  

B. Actual damages in the amount of $1,200, or as determined by the Court.  

C. Treble damages pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14** for Defendant’s willful failure to restore adequate heat.  

D. Plaintiff’s reasonable costs and expenses, as permitted by law.  

E. Any other relief this Court deems just and proper.
