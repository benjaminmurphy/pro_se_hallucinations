**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  
__________________________________________

**Introduction**

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Samantha Greene, and brings this Complaint for Modification and respectfully moves this Honorable Court to modify the existing custody order entered by this Court on May 15, 2018. Plaintiff asserts that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the current order such that modification is necessary to serve the best interests of the parties' minor child, Emily Greene.  

This action is brought under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 208, § 28, and other applicable law.  
 
**Parties**

1. **Plaintiff Samantha Greene** resides at [Insert Address], in [City/Town], Massachusetts.  
2. **Defendant James Greene** resides at [Insert Address], in [City/Town], Massachusetts.  
3. The parties are the parents of one minor child: Emily Greene, born on [DOB].

**Factual Allegations**

4. The parties' marriage was dissolved by a Judgment of Divorce Nisi entered on [Insert Date], as amended and supplemented by a custody order entered on May 15, 2018.  
5. Under the existing order, the parties share physical custody of their minor child, Emily Greene, on a week-on/week-off basis, with equal parenting time.  
6. At the time the original custody order was issued, both parties lived within close proximity to each other and were in good health. Said arrangement worked well for the minor child, who thrived under the established routines in both households.  
7. Since the date of the last order, Defendant James Greene has been diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition that substantially limits Defendant's physical capabilities.  
8. As a result of his condition, Defendant has reportedly experienced multiple falls at home and has been advised by his medical providers not to engage in activities that require rapid physical responses, particularly when caring for a minor child.  
9. Despite this advice, Defendant has continued to follow the existing 50/50 shared physical custody arrangement, during which he regularly relies on Emily to assist him with mobility tasks, including helping him out of his wheelchair and fetching necessary items.  
10. Emily, who is only twelve years old, has expressed discomfort to Plaintiff about her increased caregiving responsibilities and fear for Defendant’s safety.  
11. Defendant’s diminished ability to physically care for Emily poses risks to her safety, particularly in situations involving stairs, emergencies, and other instances requiring immediate action.  
12. Further, Defendant has not volunteered to adjust the custody schedule, even after discussions with Plaintiff regarding the safety concerns and Emily's expressed discomfort.  
13. Plaintiff is willing and able to provide primary physical custody of Emily while maintaining meaningful parenting time with Defendant that aligns with his physical capabilities.  

**Applicable Law and Legal Standards**  

14. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, a custody order may be modified if the moving party demonstrates a material and substantial change in circumstances that affects the best interests of the child. [See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); *Custody of Zia*, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 237 (2000).]  
15. The best interests of the child standard governs all custody determinations, and the court must assess factors such as the child’s safety, well-being, and stability when evaluating custody arrangements. [See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).]  
16. When a parent’s physical or mental health deteriorates such that it impacts their ability to safely and consistently care for a child, courts have found such circumstances sufficient to justify modification. [See *Williams v. Massa*, 431 Mass. 619 (2000); *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).]  
17. Courts also disfavor custodial arrangements where a minor child feels undue responsibility for the care of a parent, as such scenarios can place inappropriate emotional and physical burdens on the child that may impede their development. [See *Adoption of Oliver*, 42 Mass. App. Ct. 311 (1997).]  

**Material Change in Circumstances**

18. Defendant’s deteriorating health condition constitutes a material change in circumstances warranting modification of the current custody order due to its adverse impact on the minor child’s safety and well-being.  
19. Plaintiff has demonstrated her ability to provide a safe, stable, and nurturing environment for Emily, and the requested modification is in the child’s best interests.  

**Relief Requested**

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Samantha Greene respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter an order as follows:  

1. Modify the existing custody order to award primary physical custody of the minor child, Emily Greene, to Plaintiff, while ensuring that Defendant is awarded reasonable parenting time consistent with his physical capabilities and Emily’s best interests.  
2. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems appropriate and just.  

Respectfully submitted this 1st day of December, 2025.  

**Respectfully Submitted,**  
**Samantha Greene**  
*Plaintiff, Pro Se*
