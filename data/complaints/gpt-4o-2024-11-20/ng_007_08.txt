2. As a direct result of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff’s eight-year-old son sustained a traumatic head injury, requiring medical treatment, and Plaintiff suffered significant financial losses in the form of medical expenses.  

**II. PARTIES**  

3. Plaintiff Jason Smith is an individual residing in Brockton, Massachusetts.  

4. Defendant Brockton Community Center is a community center operating at 45 Thatcher St, Brockton, Massachusetts, that offers an after-school program for children.  

**III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

5. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 3, as the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000 and involves allegations of negligence under Massachusetts law.  

6. Venue is proper in Bristol County pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1, as the events giving rise to this action occurred in Brockton, Massachusetts, which is located in Bristol County.  

**IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

7. On September 15, 2023, Plaintiff’s eight-year-old son was participating in an after-school program at Brockton Community Center located at 45 Thatcher St, Brockton, MA.  

8. Defendant's program advertised and assured parents, including Plaintiff, that children would be supervised at all times by responsible and attentive staff members during the program, including activities in the gymnasium.  

9. On the date of the incident, there were approximately twenty children in the gymnasium who were supposed to be supervised by two staff members.  

10. One of the staff members left the gymnasium, leaving only one individual to supervise the group.  

11. The remaining staff member was distracted by her phone and failed to adequately monitor the children's activity, instead remaining near the bleachers and ignoring complaints from other children.  

12. During this time, two older children began playing an aggressive game of tackle, creating an unsafe environment on the gymnasium’s hardwood floor.  

13. Plaintiff’s son, who was smaller than the older boys, was tackled by one of them, causing him to fall and hit his head on the hardwood floor with great force.  

14. Plaintiff’s son lost consciousness for approximately thirty seconds before regaining consciousness and was later treated at the emergency room, where he was diagnosed with a concussion.  

15. Plaintiff’s son missed several days of school and required follow-up care, resulting in medical expenses of approximately $4,500.  

16. Despite knowing of the dangerous conduct of these older children and being notified about the ongoing rough play, the supervising staff member failed to intervene or otherwise act reasonably to prevent harm.  

17. Defendant failed to provide adequate supervision or to prevent harm to Plaintiff’s son, despite owing a duty of care to Plaintiff and his child as a provider of child care services.  

**V. CAUSE OF ACTION**  

**Count I: Negligence**  

18. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs of this Complaint as though fully set forth herein.  

19. Under Massachusetts law, Defendant owed a duty of reasonable care to Plaintiff's son, as a participant in its after-school program, to ensure his safety and to adequately supervise activities under the program’s control.  

20. Defendant breached its duty of care by:  
   a. Failing to properly supervise children in its after-school program;  
   b. Failing to assign or maintain an adequate number of staff to supervise twenty children in the gymnasium;  
   c. Allowing one staff member to remain distracted and inattentive while dangerous behavior occurred; and  
   d. Failing to act to stop ongoing, unsafe conduct after being notified of the dangerous behavior by other children.  

21. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff’s son sustained a concussion and related injuries, and Plaintiff incurred damages including medical expenses of approximately $4,500.  

22. Defendant’s breaches of duty are actionable under Massachusetts law, including G.L. c. 231, § 85, which establishes the general principles of negligence and liability.
