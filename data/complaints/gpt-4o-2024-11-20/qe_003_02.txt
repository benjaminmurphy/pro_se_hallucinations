### **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

7. On or about February 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a written lease agreement with Defendant to rent the studio apartment located at 123 Maple Street, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, for $1,500 per month.  
8. During an initial showing of the property, Plaintiff noticed water stains on the ceiling of the apartment and asked Defendant about them. Defendant assured Plaintiff that the water damage was from an old leak that had been "totally fixed."  
9. Despite Defendant's assurances, the apartment has suffered from repeated and worsening water leaks since Plaintiff took occupancy, particularly during rainstorms.  
10. After the first heavy rainstorm following Plaintiff's move-in, water began dripping through the same area of the ceiling where Plaintiff had observed the water stains.  
11. Plaintiff repeatedly notified Defendant about the water leaks, both verbally and in writing. However, Defendant has failed to remedy the leaking ceiling or address the worsening damage.  
12. Defendant has dismissed Plaintiff's concerns as a "minor cosmetic issue" and has claimed that such issues are part of the "character" of the apartment.  
13. The water leaks have caused significant damage to Plaintiff’s personal property, including the ruin of her couch and damage to her laptop, which cost Plaintiff approximately $900 to replace.  
14. The persistent leaks have also created a musty odor in the apartment, leading Plaintiff to suspect the presence of mold. Plaintiff has experienced frequent headaches, which she reasonably believes are related to the environmental conditions caused by Defendant's failure to repair the leaks.  
15. As a direct result of the leaks and related hazards, Plaintiff has been forced to rearrange her living space, moving her bed away from the affected area, and is effectively living in only half of the apartment.  
16. Defendant’s actions and inactions have rendered the apartment significantly less habitable, substantially depriving Plaintiff of the use and enjoyment of her home.

### **CAUSE OF ACTION**  

**(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – M.G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  

17. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the factual allegations set forth above.  
18. Under Massachusetts law, including M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, every lease contains an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, ensuring that tenants can enjoy their property free from interference by the landlord or others acting under the landlord's control.  
19. Defendant has breached this covenant by failing to repair the persistent leaks in the ceiling, allowing water intrusion and mold to develop, and refusing to take reasonable action to address the unsafe living conditions in Plaintiff's apartment.  
20. Defendant’s failure to repair the leaks has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her home, causing her to suffer damages including:  
    a. Loss of personal property valued at $900;  
    b. Diminished use and enjoyment of the apartment; and  
    c. Emotional distress, headaches, and related discomfort caused by the mold and unsafe conditions.  
21. Under M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, Defendant is liable for actual damages and statutory damages for breaching the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

B. Awarding statutory damages pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186, § 14;  
C. Awarding Plaintiff attorneys’ fees and costs, as authorized by M.G.L. c. 186, § 14; and
