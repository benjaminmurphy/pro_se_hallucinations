However, the core holding is broader\u2014a general common-law duty of reasonable care by landlords to tenants\u2019 guests\u2014rather than a narrow rule that any statutory violation constitutes negligence. The case therefore supports the general idea that statutory safety obligations can ground negligence liability, but it does not squarely adopt a per se \u201cstatutory violation = negligence\u201d rule.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"Our statutes do not support limiting a landlord\u2019s negligence liability to areas under his control. General Laws c. 186, \u00a7 19, requires most landlords to exercise reasonable care to correct an unsafe condition of which the tenant or a code enforcement agency has given him notice. If a landlord fails to correct the condition within a reasonable time, the tenant or any person rightfully on the premises has a tort action against the landlord for injuries sustained. General Laws c. 186, \u00a7 15, renders invalid any lease clause which has the effect of indemnifying the landlord or exculpating him from \u2018any . . . negligence ... on or about the leased . . . premises.\u2019\""
