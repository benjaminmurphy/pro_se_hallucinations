**RACHEL THOMPSON**,  
    Plaintiff,  

v.  

**DANIEL THOMPSON**,  
    Defendant.  

-----------------------------------------

### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Rachel Thompson, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and the equitable power of this Court, and respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the existing custody order entered on May 15, 2018, in the Norfolk Probate and Family Court, concerning the custody of Emily Thompson, the parties' minor child. As grounds thereof, the Plaintiff states as follows:

---

### PARTIES  

1. The Plaintiff, Rachel Thompson, is the mother of the minor child, Emily Thompson, born on October 10, 2013, and resides at 123 Main Street, Quincy, Massachusetts.  

2. The Defendant, Daniel Thompson, is the father of the minor child and resides at 456 Elm Lane, Dedham, Massachusetts.

---

### JURISDICTION  

3. This Court has jurisdiction to modify the custody order pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, as the original custody order in issue was entered in this Court on May 15, 2018, and the parties and the child continue to reside in Massachusetts.

---

### FACTUAL BACKGROUND  

4. On May 15, 2018, the Norfolk Probate and Family Court issued a custody order granting the parties joint legal custody and shared physical custody of Emily Thompson, with each parent exercising physical custody on a "one week on, one week off" schedule.  

5. From 2018 until recently, this arrangement worked well, as both parties resided in nearby homes and were physically able to meet Emily’s needs.  

6. Since the entry of the original custody order, there has been a material change in circumstances.  

7. Specifically, Daniel Thompson has been diagnosed with a progressive neurological condition that affects his motor coordination, balance, and mobility, creating a safety risk for the child in certain situations.  

8. As a result of his condition, Daniel Thompson has fallen multiple times at home. His doctor has advised him that he should not be alone with Emily in situations requiring rapid physical response or near stairs.  

9. Nevertheless, despite these medical recommendations, Daniel Thompson continues to insist on maintaining the existing custodial arrangement.  

10. On several occasions, Emily has been required to assist Daniel with physically demanding or unsafe tasks, such as helping him move from his wheelchair to bed or retrieving items from hazardous areas, creating undue stress and potential harm for a 12-year-old child.  

11. Emily is emotionally affected by these events and often expresses anxiety about her father's physical condition and the responsibility placed on her.  

12. The Plaintiff is concerned that the current 50/50 schedule no longer serves Emily’s best interests and exposes her to unnecessary physical and emotional risks.  

13. The Plaintiff seeks primary physical custody of Emily, with parenting time for the Defendant to be structured around his ability to provide a safe and stable environment.  

---

### BASIS FOR MODIFICATION  

14. In Massachusetts, modifying a custody order requires a material and substantial change in circumstances and a determination that the modification is in the best interests of the child. See *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).  

15. Daniel Thompson’s diagnosis of a progressive neurological condition, his resulting physical limitations, and the impact on the safety and well-being of Emily constitute a material and substantial change in circumstances. See *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488, 494 (2012) (recognizing illnesses or physical limitations as valid grounds to reconsider prior custody orders).  

16. The Court is guided in custody matters by the "best interests of the child" standard. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985).  

17. The Supreme Judicial Court has emphasized that stability, safety, and the developmental needs of the child are paramount in determining custody issues. See *Custody of a Minor*, 389 Mass. 755, 766 (1983).  

18. The current custodial arrangement exposes Emily to unnecessary safety risks and responsibilities beyond her ability, which are not in her best interests. See *Bezio v. Patenaude*, 381 Mass. 563, 576 (1980) (noting the importance of a safe environment for the child in custody determinations).  

19. Modifying the custody order to grant Rachel Thompson primary physical custody will better ensure Emily’s emotional and physical needs are met. See *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 401-02 (1981).  

20. The Defendant’s medical condition and its implications also suggest that shared physical custody may no longer be feasible or appropriate. See *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 262 (2001).  

21. The stability provided by a primary residence with the Plaintiff is in Emily’s best interests. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 183 (2006).  

22. The Plaintiff proposes a parenting plan that maximizes safe and meaningful time between Emily and the Defendant while prioritizing her well-being. See *Fort v. Fort*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 411, 418 (1981).  

23. It is in Emily’s best interests for this Court to modify the existing custody arrangement. See G.L. c. 208, § 28.

### REQUEST FOR RELIEF  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Rachel Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Find that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances warranting modification of the custody order entered on May 15, 2018.  

2. Modify the custody order to grant the Plaintiff primary physical custody of Emily Thompson.  

3. Order a parenting plan that allows the Defendant reasonable, structured parenting time consistent with his physical abilities and Emily’s best interests.  

4. Award such other relief as this Court deems just and equitable.
