### FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

5. On August 15, 2023, at approximately 7:00 p.m., Plaintiff Emily Johnson was dining at Café Delight, located at 123 Ocean Ave, Quincy, Massachusetts.  
6. While walking down the hallway between the kitchen and the dining area to access the restroom, Plaintiff slipped on water and ice that had been left on the floor.  
7. The water and ice had been spilled roughly ten minutes earlier when a server dropped a tray of water glasses in the same hallway.  
8. The server picked up the broken glass but failed to clean up the water and ice, nor did the server place any wet floor sign or warning in the vicinity of the spill.   
9. Defendant’s employees, including the server, negligently allowed the water to remain on the tile floor for an unreasonably lengthy period of time, despite acknowledging the spill and the increased risk of harm to patrons.  
10. Plaintiff saw the water glistening on the tile floor but, having no warning about the condition and believing it to be the natural shininess of clean tiles, stepped on the water and immediately slipped, falling backward and twisting her knee in the process.  
11. Following the fall, Plaintiff overheard other staff members at Café Delight stating that they had been "dodging that puddle" for some time and expressing awareness of the hazard.  
12. As a direct result of the Defendant's negligence, the Plaintiff suffered serious injuries including a knee sprain, which required a knee brace and several weeks of physical therapy.  
13. Plaintiff incurred medical expenses in the approximate amount of $2,500.00 for treatment directly related to the injury.  
14. Plaintiff also lost approximately $1,200.00 in wages due to her inability to work while recovering from the injury.

### COUNT I: NEGLIGENCE  

15. Plaintiff incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth herein.  
16. The Defendant owed a duty of reasonable care to all invited patrons, including the Plaintiff, to maintain the premises in safe condition and to warn patrons of any known or reasonably discoverable dangers. See Doherty v. Spano, 54 Mass. App. Ct. 278, 281 (2002).  
17. Defendant breached its duty of care in the following ways:  
    a. By failing to clean up the water and ice in a timely manner;  
    b. By failing to warn patrons, including the Plaintiff, of the dangerous condition created by the spilled water and ice, such as by using wet floor signs or other warnings; and  
    c. By allowing the hazardous condition to persist for an unreasonable period of time despite knowledge of the danger.  
18. Defective or dangerous conditions such as unmarked wet floors could and should have been timely remedied by Defendant’s employees with the exercise of ordinary care. See Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc., 448 Mass. 780, 784-85 (2007).  
19. Defendant had actual knowledge of the dangerous condition, as evidenced by its employees’ statements and actions, and/or constructive knowledge, as the condition existed for a length of time sufficient for a reasonably prudent employee to address the issue. See Oliveri v. Stop & Shop Supermarket Co., LLC, 72 Mass. App. Ct. 375, 377-79 (2008).  
20. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's negligence, the Plaintiff suffered injuries, economic losses, and emotional distress, including but not limited to:  
    a. Physical injuries, including a sprained knee;  
    b. Medical expenses in the approximate amount of $2,500.00;  
    c. Lost wages in the approximate amount of $1,200.00;  
    d. Pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of life due to the injury and its aftermath.  
21. Under Massachusetts law, business owners owe a heightened duty of care to invitees because of the foreseeability of harm posed by dangerous conditions on their premises. See Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 706 (1973).  
22. Plaintiff reasonably relied on Defendant maintaining the premises in a reasonably safe condition and/or providing adequate warnings about any dangerous conditions, which Defendant negligently failed to do.
