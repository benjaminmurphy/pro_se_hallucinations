It does not articulate or endorse the familiar rule that a defendant owes a lawful invitee a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the premises safely and warn of hidden or foreseeable dangers. While Mounsey as a whole discusses occupiers\u2019 duties, this particular cited page and passage do not clearly support the specific invitee-duty proposition stated.",

But footnote 7 seems to say that \u2018trespassers\u2019 stand apart, that that characterization is to remain decisive or highly influential.\""

      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cBecause we now abolish the distinction between the natural and unnatural accumulation of snow and ice, and because we apply the premises liability standard of reasonable care retroactively to injuries from slips and falls arising from accumulations of snow and ice, we vacate the allowance of summary judgment in favor of the defendants, and remand the case to the Superior Court for reconsideration of the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment in light of this opinion.\u201d"

Therefore it cannot support the proposition about a defendant\u2019s knowledge of a puddle of spilled milk in a dairy aisle.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Plainly the Superior Court dealt with the contempt civilly and not criminally. The imprisonment ordered was merely a sanction to compel the contemnor to furnish protection to the civil rights of the plaintiff in the equity suit.

Instead, the court holds that the social host owed no common-law duty under these facts and affirms summary judgment for the defendant. While the case notes that the plaintiff suffered severe injuries, it is only as background; the decision is about the absence of duty and thus rejects, rather than supports, a causation/damages proposition against this defendant.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cAs a result of the collision, the plaintiff suffered severe and permanent physical injuries.\u2026 Any liability on the defendant's part in such a situation must be grounded in the common law of negligence\u2026 meaning that the plaintiff has the burden of proving each and every element of that claim: duty, breach of duty (or, the element of negligence), causation (actual and proximate) and damages.\u2026 Since no common law duty exists here, it follows that the statutes relied on by the plaintiff do not of themselves create a cause of action in tort.\u201d"

The opinion explains that while the defendant is not an insurer, it has a duty to keep the premises reasonably safe, and liability may be found where the hazard existed long enough and in a location visible to employees that the store should have known of and remedied it. This directly supports the proposition of liability for failing to prevent or address unsafe conditions on business premises.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe defendant owed to customers a duty to keep the premises reasonably safe for their use. He, however, is not an insurer of safety. Where, without action for which he is responsible, a dangerous condition arises, the law allows him reasonable opportunity to become informed of the danger and to take measures to remedy it. He is not liable, in such a case, unless he is negligent in failing to inform himself and to take appropriate action\u2026 The plaintiff\u2019s right to recover therefore depends upon evidence from which the jury could find that the defendant, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known of and removed this foreign substance.\u201d"
