**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**BOSTON MUNICIPAL COURT – ROXBURY DIVISION**  
___________________________  

**JORDAN LEE,**  
*Plaintiff*,  

v.  

**MARTHA JOHNSON,**  
*Defendant*.  
___________________________  

**COMPLAINT**  

**INTRODUCTION**  
1. Plaintiff Jordan Lee (“Plaintiff”), residing at 345 Walnut Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts, brings this action against Defendant Martha Johnson (“Defendant”), Plaintiff’s landlord, for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, § 14.  

2. Plaintiff seeks damages resulting from Defendant’s failure to remedy significant water intrusion, which caused property damage, increased utility costs, and deprived Plaintiff of the full use and enjoyment of the premises.  

**PARTIES**  
3. Plaintiff Jordan Lee is a tenant residing at 345 Walnut Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119.  

4. Defendant Martha Johnson is the owner and landlord of the property where Plaintiff resides, with a mailing address to be determined upon discovery but known to Plaintiff as the person or entity responsible for the management of the premises.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
5. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, § 14 and c. 218, § 19, as this case involves a residential landlord-tenant dispute and the amount in controversy does not exceed the jurisdictional limit of the Boston Municipal Court.  

6. Venue is proper in the Roxbury Division of the Boston Municipal Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 2, as the property at issue is located in Roxbury, Massachusetts.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
7. On or about March 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant for the basement unit located at 345 Walnut Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts 02119 (the “Premises”).  

8. Plaintiff’s monthly rent under the lease agreement is $1,200, which Plaintiff has paid in full except for a brief delay in October 2025, when rent was tendered late by approximately two weeks, with late fees included.  

9. In or around November 2025, Plaintiff noticed water seeping through the walls of the Premises whenever it rained heavily, rendering a portion of the Premises unusable and exposing Plaintiff to unhealthy living conditions, including possible mold contamination.  

10. On or about November 7, 2025, Plaintiff notified Defendant of the water intrusion by text message, to which Defendant responded she would “look into it.”  

11. By late November 2025, Defendant had taken no meaningful steps to remedy the water intrusion, prompting Plaintiff to contact Boston Inspectional Services.  

12. Upon inspection of the Premises, the City of Boston identified multiple code violations, including but not limited to issues related to water intrusion.  

13. As a result of the water intrusion into the Premises, Plaintiff sustained personal property damage of approximately $400, including ruined rugs and a damaged bookshelf.  

14. Plaintiff has been forced to run a dehumidifier almost continuously to combat excessive moisture in the Premises, thereby incurring increased electricity costs.  

15. Defendant has, in retaliation for Plaintiff’s reporting the code violation, recently stated her intent not to renew Plaintiff’s lease, citing Plaintiff’s brief delay in rent payment in October 2025 as a pretextual excuse.  

16. Despite Defendant’s obligation under Massachusetts law to maintain the Premises in a habitable condition and promptly repair defects, the water intrusion remains unresolved, depriving Plaintiff of the quiet enjoyment of the leased premises.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**(Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  
17. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  

18. Under Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, § 14, a landlord is prohibited from interfering with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment of their rented premises.  

19. Massachusetts courts have held that a landlord’s failure to address unsafe conditions or habitability issues constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994); *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 102 (1982).  

20. Defendant’s failure to address the water intrusion problem, despite receiving notice from Plaintiff and the City of Boston, constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. See *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847, 850 (1997) (a landlord’s inaction after notice of defects constitutes interference with quiet enjoyment); *Dartmouth v. Posner*, 18 Mass. App. Ct. 922 (1984).  

21. Defendant’s apparent retaliatory refusal to renew Plaintiff’s lease, despite Plaintiff’s protected activities of reporting code violations, further interferes with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment. See G.L. c. 186, § 18; *Attorney Gen. v. Dime Sav. Bank of NY, FSB*, 413 Mass. 284 (1992).  

22. As a direct result of Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff has suffered damages, including property loss, increased utility costs, and emotional distress. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 95 (1982) (recognizing emotional distress damages in tenant claims).  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jordan Lee respectfully requests that this Court:  

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and find that Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment;  

B. Award Plaintiff monetary damages in the amount of $400 for property damage, increased electricity costs, and related losses, or such amount as this Court deems just and proper;  

C. Award Plaintiff additional statutory damages pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, in an amount equal to three months’ rent, or $3,600, for Defendant’s intentional interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment;  

D. Award Plaintiff attorney’s fees and costs pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14;  

E. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
