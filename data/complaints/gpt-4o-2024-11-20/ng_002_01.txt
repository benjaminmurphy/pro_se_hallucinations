**EMILY JOHNSON**, Plaintiff,  
v.  
**MARK THOMPSON**, Defendant.
------------------------------------  

**COMPLAINT**  

**INTRODUCTION**  

1. This is a civil action for negligence arising from injuries sustained by Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, as a direct result of Defendant Mark Thompson’s failure to control his unleashed dog in violation of Massachusetts law and municipal ordinances.  

2. Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages for her medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering caused by the Defendant’s negligent conduct.  

**PARTIES**  

3. Plaintiff, **Emily Johnson**, resides in Newton, Massachusetts.  

4. Defendant, **Mark Thompson**, resides in Newton, Massachusetts.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

5. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter under G.L. c. 218, § 19.  

6. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1, as the incident giving rise to this claim occurred in Newton, Massachusetts, within the jurisdiction of this Court.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

7. On or about May 15, 2023, Plaintiff Emily Johnson was jogging on a designated path in Newton Park, located at **123 Maple Street**, Newton, Massachusetts.  

8. Newton Park prominently displays signs requiring all dogs to be kept on leashes pursuant to Newton Ordinance § 11.4 and Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 140, Section 155.  

9. Defendant Mark Thompson was present at Newton Park with his large dog at the same time Plaintiff was jogging on the pathway.  

10. Defendant had a leash with him but failed to attach it to his dog, thereby allowing the dog to roam freely and unsupervised, in direct violation of the aforementioned laws.  

11. As Plaintiff was jogging on the path, Defendant’s unleashed dog suddenly charged at Plaintiff, barking loudly and behaving aggressively.  

12. The dog’s unexpected behavior caused Plaintiff to fear for her safety and divert her stride to avoid potential harm.  

13. In attempting to evade the sudden approach of the unleashed dog, Plaintiff tripped over a tree root off the pathway and fell down an embankment, fracturing her wrist.  

14. Defendant was approximately thirty feet from the dog and negligently failed to properly control or restrain the animal despite being in violation of mandatory leash laws.  

15. Several eyewitnesses observed the incident, including the dog’s aggressive actions, Defendant’s failure to control the dog, and Plaintiff’s fall down the embankment.  

16. Following the incident, Plaintiff sought immediate medical treatment at an emergency room and was diagnosed with a fractured wrist.  

17. As a result of the injury, Plaintiff incurred **$3,500** in medical expenses and lost **$1,200** in wages due to her inability to work during her recovery.  

18. Plaintiff additionally suffered significant pain and emotional distress and was unable to participate in personal activities, including a piano recital for which she had been preparing.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
*(Negligence)*  

19. Plaintiff reasserts and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1–18 of this Complaint.  

20. Defendant owed a duty of reasonable care to all individuals lawfully present in Newton Park, including Plaintiff.  

21. Defendant further owed Plaintiff a duty to comply with Massachusetts leash laws, notably Mass. Gen. Laws c. 140, § 155, and Newton Ordinance § 11.4, which are designed to protect the public from unrestrained dogs.  

22. Defendant breached his duty of care by failing to keep his dog on a leash and allowing it to roam freely in a public park.  

23. Defendant’s actions were in violation of the reasonable care standard set forth in Massachusetts law, including the principles articulated in **Mounsey v. Ellard**, 363 Mass. 693 (1973) (affirming a landowner’s duty to lawful visitors) and **Bonner v. Sudbury**, 83 Mass. App. Ct. 1102 (2013) (addressing the liability of dog owners for their failure to control pets).  

24. Defendant’s breach of duty was the proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries, as established under Massachusetts negligence law, including **Morgan v. Lalumiere**, 22 Mass. App. Ct. 262 (1986) (addressing foreseeability and proximate cause in negligence claims).  

25. Plaintiff’s injuries were not the result of her own negligence but were directly caused by Defendant’s failure to act reasonably and lawfully in controlling his dog.  

26. The leash laws at issue create a legal duty on the part of dog owners to maintain control of their dogs, as recognized in **Irwin v. Ware**, 392 Mass. 745 (1984).  

27. Defendant’s failure to secure his dog and prevent it from charging at Plaintiff was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff’s injuries, as further supported in **Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.**, 457 Mass. 368 (2010).  

28. Massachusetts law holds dog owners strictly responsible for injuries caused by their dogs when the owner fails to comply with applicable leash statutes, as noted in **Maillet v. Mininno**, 266 Mass. 86 (1929).  

29. Defendant’s conduct constitutes negligence per se under Massachusetts law interpreting violations of public safety statutes, such as in **Ferreira v. Strack**, 652 N.E.2d 811 (Mass. App. Ct. 1995).  

30. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's negligent conduct, Plaintiff has sustained physical injuries, medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and emotional distress.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Johnson respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and award the following relief:  

A. Compensatory damages in the amount of $4,700 for medical expenses and lost wages, or such other amount as proven at trial;  

B. Additional damages for pain, suffering, and emotional distress in an amount to be determined by the jury;  

C. Costs of this action, including reasonable attorneys' fees as allowed by law; and  

D. Such other relief as this Court deems just and proper under the circumstances.  

**JURY DEMAND**  

Plaintiff respectfully demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,
