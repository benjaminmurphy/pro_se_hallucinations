v.  

**Robert Thompson,**  
Defendant.  

**Civil Action No. __________**  

**COMPLAINT**  

**INTRODUCTION**  
Plaintiff, Jessica Martin, brings this negligence action against Defendant, Robert Thompson, for damages caused as a result of Defendant’s negligent maintenance and storage of property, which resulted in direct harm to Plaintiff’s vehicle. This harm occurred on or about March 15, 2023, at 34 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts.

**PARTIES**  
1. Plaintiff, Jessica Martin, is an individual residing at 34 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts.  
2. Defendant, Robert Thompson, is an individual who, upon information and belief, resides at 34A Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
3. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 212, § 4, as the amount in controversy exceeds the statutory minimum.  
4. Venue in this Court is proper under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223, § 1, as the events giving rise to this suit occurred in Hampden County.

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
5. Plaintiff resides in a duplex located at 34 Maple Street in Springfield, Massachusetts, which includes a shared driveway that is also used by Defendant.  
6. Defendant habitually stored a tall aluminum extension ladder by leaning it unsecured against a wooden fence situated adjacent to the shared driveway.  
7. Plaintiff had previously expressed concerns to Defendant that the ladder was unsecured and might fall. Plaintiff specifically informed Defendant that the ladder posed a foreseeable risk of falling onto Plaintiff’s vehicle, particularly during windy conditions.  
8. Defendant assured Plaintiff that he would take steps to secure the ladder by tying it down or moving it; however, Defendant failed to do so.  
9. On March 15, 2023, during a windy day, Plaintiff was backing her vehicle into the shared driveway when a gust of wind caused the unsecured ladder to fall.  
10. The falling ladder struck Plaintiff’s car, causing a dent in the hood and cracking the windshield.  
11. As a result of the incident, Plaintiff incurred the following damages:  
   a. Costs for bodywork repair on the hood: $1,200;  
   b. Costs for windshield replacement: $900;  
   c. Rental car expenses: $400;  
   d. Insurance deductible: $500.  
12. Defendant’s failure to secure or remove the ladder constitutes a breach of his duty to exercise reasonable care in maintaining his property, posing an unreasonable risk to Plaintiff.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION: NEGLIGENCE**  
13. Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the allegations set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 12 of this Complaint as though fully stated herein.  
14. Under Massachusetts law, Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to act with reasonable care to avoid creating hazardous or dangerous conditions on the shared driveway, which both Plaintiff and Defendant had a right to use for vehicular access. See Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 708 (1973).  
15. Defendant knew or should have known that his failure to properly secure or relocate the aluminum ladder created an unreasonable risk that it might fall and cause damage, particularly during windy conditions. See Donovan v. Johnson, 301 Mass. 12, 14 (1938).  
16. Defendant breached his duty of care by negligently failing to:  
   a. Remove the ladder from an unsteady position near the driveway;  
   b. Properly secure the ladder to prevent it from falling; and  
   c. Take adequate precautions to ensure that the ladder posed no foreseeable threat of harm to others.  
17. Defendant’s breach of his duty of care was the direct and proximate cause of the damages sustained by Plaintiff. See Jesionek v. Massachusetts Port Authority, 376 Mass. 101, 106 (1978).  
18. Plaintiff's damages were foreseeable and preventable had Defendant exercised reasonable care. See Restatement (Second) of Torts, § 343.  

**DAMAGES**  
19. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has incurred the following costs:  
   a. Repair costs to the hood and windshield in the amount of $2,100;  
   b. Rental car expenses in the amount of $400;  
   c. Insurance deductible in the amount of $500.  
20. Plaintiff has further suffered inconvenience and disruption to her daily life due to the loss of use of her vehicle during the period when repairs were completed.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and award the following relief:  
1. Damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but no less than $3,000, including compensatory damages for the cost of repairs and associated expenses.  
2. Court costs, interest, and any other relief this Court deems just and proper under the circumstances.  

**JURY DEMAND**  
Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all counts so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,  

Dated: December 1, 2025
