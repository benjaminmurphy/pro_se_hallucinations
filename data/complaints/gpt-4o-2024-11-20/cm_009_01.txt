### **JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

3. This Honorable Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, and venue is appropriate in this Court under G.L. c. 223, § 1.  
4. This Court previously issued an order regarding custody and parenting time on May 15, 2019, establishing the Plaintiff as the primary custodial parent and providing the Defendant parenting time every other weekend and one midweek overnight on Wednesdays.

---

### **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

5. At the time of the original custody order in 2019, the Plaintiff and Defendant lived in the same town, enabling efficient midweek transitions for the Wednesday overnight parenting time.  
6. Since the time of the original order, the Defendant has relocated to Cape Cod, which is approximately ninety (90) miles from the Plaintiff’s residence and Sophie’s school.  
7. Despite moving a significant distance away, the Defendant continues to exercise the midweek Wednesday overnight parenting time.  
8. On those Wednesdays, the Defendant picks Sophie up from school, drives approximately ninety (90) miles to his residence in Cape Cod, and then wakes Sophie as early as 4:30 AM the following morning to bring her back to school.  
9. Sophie, now eight years old and a third-grader, has been struggling with the schedule. She is consistently exhausted on Thursdays, as evidenced by:  
   a. Reports from Sophie’s teacher noting a significant drop in her participation, attentiveness, and energy levels on Thursdays.  
   b. Observations from the Plaintiff that Sophie experiences fatigue and difficulty getting sufficient sleep on Wednesday nights when staying with the Defendant.  
10. This travel and disruption to Sophie’s sleep and education constitute a substantial material change in circumstances since the original custody order and adversely affect Sophie’s best interests.  
11. The Plaintiff has attempted to address these concerns with the Defendant, who has refused to alter the current custody schedule.

### **REQUESTED MODIFICATION**  

12. In accordance with G.L. c. 208, § 28, a custody or parenting time order may be modified if there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances and if such modification is in the best interests of the child.  

13. Massachusetts courts consistently emphasize that the paramount consideration in custody or parenting time matters is the best interests of the child. See **Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704 (1985)**; **Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981)**.  

14. A material change warranting modification has occurred here, as the Defendant’s move to Cape Cod and the long commute Sophie endures on school nights have impaired her well-being and educational performance. See **Hunter v. Rose, 463 Mass. 488 (2012)** (material changes in physical or educational circumstances as grounds for modification).  

15. The requested modification seeks to eliminate the midweek overnight parenting time and adjust the parenting schedule to align with Sophie’s developmental and educational needs, ensuring her stability and well-being.  

16. Courts have determined that minimizing disruptions to a child’s education and routine is critical to a child’s best interests. See **Ducey v. Ducey, 26 Mass. App. Ct. 673 (1988)**; **Smith v. McDonald, 458 Mass. 540 (2010)**.  

17. The requested modification is narrowly tailored to meet Sophie’s needs while ensuring that meaningful parenting time continues between the Defendant and Sophie. See **Schechter v. Schechter, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015)**.  

18. The Plaintiff proposes eliminating midweek overnight parenting time and alternatively adjusting the Defendant’s parenting time to a schedule that does not interfere with Sophie’s sleep or education, such as consolidating parenting time into weekends during the school year.  

19. Where the childcare arrangement causes exhaustion and disrupts a child’s education, Massachusetts courts have recognized that modification is appropriate to protect the child’s welfare. See **Rosenberg v. Merida, 428 Mass. 182 (1998)**; **Gupta v. Naik, 99 Mass. App. Ct. 120 (2021)**.  

---

### **RELIEF REQUESTED**  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Modify the custody and parenting time order entered on May 15, 2019, to eliminate the Defendant’s midweek Wednesday overnight parenting time;  
2. Adjust the parenting time schedule to reduce Sophie’s travel burden on school nights and ensure greater stability in her educational routine;  
3. Award the Plaintiff such further relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper.  

Respectfully Submitted,  

**Dated:** December 1, 2025
