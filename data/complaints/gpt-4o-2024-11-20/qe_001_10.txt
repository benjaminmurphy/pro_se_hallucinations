v.

**________________________________________**  

**COMPLAINT**  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, and files this Complaint against the Defendant, John Mitchell, and alleges as follows:

---

### **INTRODUCTION**  

1. This is a civil action to recover damages caused by the Defendant's breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, c. 186, § 14, which protects tenants from substantial interference with their rental premises.  

2. Despite the Plaintiff’s repeated complaints about heating issues in the rented premises, the Defendant failed to maintain the premises, substantially interfering with the Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her home.  

3. Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages authorized under Massachusetts law, including statutory damages, reimbursement for expenses incurred, and any other relief the Court deems appropriate.  

---

### **PARTIES**  

4. Plaintiff Sarah Thompson is a resident of Dorchester, Massachusetts, residing at 123 Elm Street, Unit 2, Dorchester, MA 02124, which she rents from the Defendant.  

5. Defendant John Mitchell, upon information and belief, is an individual who owns, operates, and is responsible for the maintenance of the rental property located at 123 Elm Street, Dorchester, MA 02124.  

---

### **JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

6. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to M.G.L. c. 218, § 19 since the damages sought are within the monetary limits of this Court.  

7. Venue is appropriate pursuant to M.G.L. c. 223, § 2, as the events giving rise to this claim occurred in Dorchester, within this Court's jurisdiction.

### **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

8. Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with the Defendant on or about January 1, 2022, to rent the premises located at 123 Elm Street, Unit 2, Dorchester, MA 02124 (the "Premises") for $1,800 per month.  

9. Massachusetts law requires landlords to provide and maintain habitable conditions in rental units, including adequate heating systems.  

10. Beginning in November 2024 and continuing throughout the winter, the heating system in the Premises failed recurrently, causing indoor temperatures to drop to approximately 60 degrees Fahrenheit for several hours, primarily during the evenings.  

11. Plaintiff promptly notified the Defendant of the heating issue. The Defendant twice dispatched repair technicians, but the problem persisted despite these efforts.  

12. The repair professionals confirmed that the boiler was "old but functional" but did not resolve the intermittent heating failures.  

13. Due to the insufficient heating and cold indoor temperatures, Plaintiff was forced to purchase two space heaters and incurred approximately $150 per month in additional electricity charges during the heating period.  

14. As a direct result of the inadequate heating, Plaintiff contracted bronchitis in January 2025, for which she incurred medical expenses including antibiotics, and missed three days of work.  

15. Despite repeated notices to the Defendant, the heating system remained deficient throughout the winter months.  

16. Defendant has refused to make further repairs, asserting that the heating system was "working" because it never completely failed and the building's temperature did not drop to freezing.  

17. Defendant’s failure to provide adequate heating constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the Premises, in violation of M.G.L. c. 186, § 14 and common law.

### **CAUSE OF ACTION**  

#### **COUNT I: BREACH OF THE IMPLIED COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT (M.G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  

18. Plaintiff incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 17 as if fully set forth herein.  

19. Under M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, every residential lease includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment. Landlords are prohibited from interfering with tenants' use and enjoyment of their rental premises.  

20. Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment by failing to ensure the heating system provided adequate heat during the winter of 2024–2025.  

21. The inadequate heating caused substantial interference with Plaintiff's ability to reside comfortably and safely in the Premises.  

22. Defendant's breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment caused Plaintiff to suffer damages, including:  

   a. Higher electricity bills due to the use of space heaters, amounting to approximately $600.  
   b. Medical expenses incurred for treating bronchitis, the severity of which was exacerbated by the cold indoor temperatures.  
   c. Lost wages for missed workdays due to illness.  

23. Defendant’s actions constitute an intentional and negligent violation of M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, entitling Plaintiff to damages, including up to three months' rent, reasonable attorneys' fees, and costs of this action.  

24. Massachusetts courts have consistently upheld tenants' rights to relief for landlords' failure to provide habitable conditions, including in *Armstrong v. Botsaris*, 20 Mass. App. Ct. 503 (1985); *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91 (1982); and *Dartt v. Browning-Ferris Industries, Inc.*, 427 Mass. 1 (1998), which acknowledge substantial interference with use and enjoyment as actionable under Massachusetts law.

1. An award of actual damages in the amount of $600 for increased electricity expenses.  
2. Compensation for additional damages resulting from medical expenses and lost wages, in an amount to be determined at trial.  
3. Statutory damages pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, in the amount of three months' rent, or $5,400.  
4. Attorney's fees and costs pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186, § 14.  
5. Any such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
