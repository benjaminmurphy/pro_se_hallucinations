### CIVIL ACTION NO. ___________  

**Jordan Smith,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**Emily Johnson,**  
Defendant.  

---

**COMPLAINT**  

**I. INTRODUCTION**  

1. This is an action brought by Plaintiff Jordan Smith against Defendant Emily Johnson for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law. Defendant's failure to repair the front entry door of the apartment building at 24 Chelsea St, Chelsea, MA, has created unsafe and unsecure living conditions, causing Plaintiff economic loss, emotional distress, and interference with the reasonable use and enjoyment of the leased premises.  

**II. PARTIES**  

2. Plaintiff Jordan Smith is an individual residing at 24 Chelsea St, Apartment _______, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150. Plaintiff has been a lawful tenant of the property since June 1, 2022, under a written lease agreement with Defendant.  

3. Defendant Emily Johnson is an individual who owns, manages, and rents out the residential property located at 24 Chelsea St, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150.  

**III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, and G.L. c. 231, §§ 1 and 2.  

5. Venue is proper in Chelsea District Court because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Chelsea, Massachusetts, and the leased premises are located within the jurisdiction of this Court.  

**IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

6. Plaintiff rents an apartment from Defendant at 24 Chelsea St, Chelsea, MA, under a written lease agreement that requires Plaintiff to pay $1,500 per month in rent.  

7. The main entry door to the apartment building is equipped with a lock that is broken and does not latch properly. As a result, the door can be pushed open by anyone, leaving the building unsecured.  

8. Plaintiff first notified Defendant of the broken door lock approximately two months ago and has made multiple follow-up requests for repair, including two additional reminders since the initial complaint.  

9. Defendant has failed to make any repairs to the broken lock, despite agreeing to do so and being aware of the ongoing issue.  

10. In November 2025, an unauthorized individual entered the building through the unsecured door and went through tenants’ mail. Several packages were stolen from the hallway, including a package belonging to Plaintiff, valued at approximately $120.  

11. Around the same time, Plaintiff began noticing evidence of unauthorized entry into the basement of the building, including disarray and evidence that someone had been sleeping there.  

12. Plaintiff has incurred out-of-pocket expenses totaling approximately $200 to secure the leased premises, including the purchase of a security camera and a deadbolt for Plaintiff’s apartment.  

13. Defendant has dismissed Plaintiff's concerns and stated that the neighborhood is safe despite clear evidence to the contrary.  

14. Defendant’s failure to address the broken door lock has materially interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to safely and peacefully enjoy the premises.  

**V. CAUSE OF ACTION**  

**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment Pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14**  

15. Plaintiff incorporates all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  

16. Under Massachusetts law, G.L. c. 186, § 14, landlords have an obligation to ensure that tenants can peacefully and reasonably use and enjoy their leased premises without interference.  

17. The covenant of quiet enjoyment prohibits landlords from taking intentional actions or permitting conditions that substantially interfere with a tenant’s use of leased premises.  

18. Defendant breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment by failing to repair the broken lock on the main entry door, allowing unauthorized entry into the building.  

19. Defendant's failure to act created unsafe and insecure conditions, which substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises and exposed Plaintiff to theft and emotional distress.  

20. Defendant’s conduct constitutes a violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14, entitling Plaintiff to damages, including compensation for economic losses and emotional harm, as well as attorneys' fees and costs.  

**VI. DAMAGES**  

21. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s actions and omissions, Plaintiff has suffered the following damages:  
   a. Economic loss of $120 due to stolen property;  
   b. Out-of-pocket expenses of $200 for a security camera and deadbolt to secure the premises;  
   c. Emotional distress due to the insecurity and ongoing risk posed by the Defendant’s failure to repair the door.  

22. Plaintiff is entitled to recover damages as provided by G.L. c. 186, § 14, including three times the actual damages as set forth above, for a total of $960, plus reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of litigation.  

**VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jordan Smith respectfully requests that this Court:  

a. Enter judgment in Plaintiff’s favor on the claim of breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;  
b. Award Plaintiff actual damages in the amount of $320 and treble damages in the amount of $960 pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14;  
c. Award Plaintiff reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in the prosecution of this action as allowed by law;  
d. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.  

**VIII. JURY DEMAND**  

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,
