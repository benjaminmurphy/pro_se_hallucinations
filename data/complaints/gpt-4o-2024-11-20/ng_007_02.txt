### **FACTS**  

5. Defendant operates an after-school program at 90 Legion Parkway, Brockton, MA 02302, which advertises supervision of children in its care during program hours.  

6. On September 15, 2023, Plaintiff’s minor child, J.J., attended the program at Defendant's facility.  

7. Defendant represented that children enrolled in the after-school program would be supervised at all times while using the facility’s gymnasium.  

8. On the date in question, J.J. was one of approximately twenty (20) children playing in the facility’s gymnasium.  

9. Defendant’s staff was required to provide adequate supervision of children. At least two staff members were assigned to oversee the children in the gymnasium on this date.  

10. One of the assigned staff members left the gymnasium to complete paperwork, leaving only one staff member, who was inattentive and distracted, spending significant time looking at her phone rather than monitoring the children.  

11. During this period of inadequate supervision, two older boys, approximately twelve years old, began playing rough, unsupervised tackle games on the hardwood floor of the gymnasium.  

12. Despite the warnings of other children notifying the sole staff member of the rough and dangerous behavior, the staff member ignored the warnings and stated, “boys will be boys.”  

13. J.J., who is eight years old and physically smaller than most children his age, was tackled forcefully by one of the older boys, causing him to hit his head on the gymnasium's hardwood floor.  

14. J.J. was rendered unconscious for approximately thirty (30) seconds before regaining consciousness.  

15. Emergency medical services were contacted, and J.J. was transported to an emergency room, where he was diagnosed with a concussion.  

16. As a result of the incident, J.J. missed several days of school and has ongoing medical expenses totaling approximately $5,500.  

17. Defendant failed to exercise reasonable care in the supervision of children at its facility, creating dangerous and foreseeable conditions that directly caused J.J.’s injuries.

### **CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**(Negligence)**  

18. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 17 as though fully set forth herein.  

19. Defendant owed a duty of reasonable care to the children in its after-school program, including but not limited to the duty to adequately supervise children using its gymnasium facilities.  

20. Defendant breached its duty of care by:  
   a. Failing to ensure adequate staffing levels in the gymnasium;    
   b. Allowing one assigned staff member to leave the gymnasium, contrary to program policies and reasonable safety protocols;  
   c. Permitting roughhousing and dangerous tackle games without intervention or supervision; and   
   d. Ignoring warnings from children about the unsafe behavior taking place.  

21. Defendant’s breach of its duty of care created foreseeable and unreasonable risks of harm to children in its care, including J.J.  

22. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, J.J. sustained serious physical injury, including but not limited to a concussion, requiring emergency medical treatment and resulting in further medical expenses, emotional distress, and missed educational opportunities.  

23. The negligence of Defendant constitutes a breach of the standard of care owed under Massachusetts law, including but not limited to the principles established in **Jesionek v. Massachusetts Port Authority**, 376 Mass. 101 (1978) (duty of reasonable care extends to protecting individuals from foreseeable harm); **Fitzsimmons v. National Grid**, 77 Mass. App. Ct. 122 (2010) (failure to act reasonably in the face of foreseeable risks constitutes actionable negligence); and **Cottam v. CVS Pharmacy**, 436 Mass. 316 (2002) (a duty to warn exists when harm is foreseeable).  

24. Defendant’s conduct is further in violation of the reasonable care standards set forth under **G.L. c. 231, § 85**, which outlines general principles of negligence liability in the Commonwealth.

2. Damages for pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life in an amount to be determined by the Court;
