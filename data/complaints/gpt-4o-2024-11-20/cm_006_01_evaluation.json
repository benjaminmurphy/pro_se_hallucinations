While the excerpt provided focuses more on custody determinations and the need to consider domestic violence than on visitation specifically, the reasoning is clearly that child safety and security must be central and overriding concerns in any custody/placement decision, which logically encompasses visitation.

We endorse the Appeals Court\u2019s commitment to the propositions that physical force within the family is both intolerable and too readily tolerated, and that a child who has been either the victim or the spectator of such abuse suffers a distinctly grievous kind of harm. \u2026 Domestic violence is an issue too fundamental and frequently recurring to be dealt with only by implication. \u2026 Requiring the courts to make explicit findings about the effect of the violence on the child \u2026 will serve to keep these matters well in the foreground of the judges\u2019 thinking.\u201d"

It holds that court-ordered visitation over parental objection is permissible only upon a showing that denying visitation would cause the child significant harm, but it does not articulate a general rule that a child\u2019s physical and emotional safety must be prioritized over parental visitation rights. Rather, it limits state interference with parental decisions to situations of demonstrated harm; it does not frame this as prioritizing the child\u2019s safety over a parent\u2019s own visitation rights with the child.",

So interpreted, the statute furthers a compelling and legitimate State interest in mitigating potential harm to children in nonintact families\u2026 We conclude\u2026 that the statute satisfies strict scrutiny because our construction narrowly tailors it to further the compelling State interest in protecting the welfare of a child\u2026 from harm.\u201d"
