**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**  

Now comes the Plaintiff, Jessica Marshall, and pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and the case law controlling custody modifications in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, respectfully moves this Honorable Court to modify the current custody order issued on September 15, 2021, by the Middlesex Probate and Family Court. Due to a material and substantial change in circumstances that endangers the welfare of the minor child, Ethan Reed, the Plaintiff seeks changes to the custody arrangement to ensure the safety and well-being of the child.  

In support of her Complaint for Modification, the Plaintiff states as follows:  

---

### **PARTIES**  

1. The Plaintiff, Jessica Marshall, resides at [Address Redacted for Privacy], Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor child, Ethan Reed. She is a fit and proper person to care for the minor child and is the primary custodial parent under the current order.  
2. The Defendant, Thomas Reed, resides at [Address Redacted for Privacy], Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor child.  

---

### **JURISDICTION**  

3. This Honorable Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 209C, § 20, as the Middlesex Probate and Family Court issued the original order on September 15, 2021, and the Plaintiff and Defendant both reside within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  

---

### **FACTUAL BACKGROUND**  

4. The parties are the parents of Ethan Reed, born on [Date of Birth Redacted for Privacy], who is currently eight (8) years old.  
5. On September 15, 2021, this Court issued a custody order granting the Plaintiff and Defendant shared legal custody of Ethan Reed, with Ethan primarily residing with the Plaintiff and visiting the Defendant on alternating weekends.  
6. At the time of entry of the original custody order, the Court determined that both parents were fit, stable, and capable of co-parenting in the best interest of the minor child.  

---

### **MATERIAL CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES**  

7. Since the entry of the original custody order, there has been a material change in circumstances that jeopardizes the health, safety, and well-being of the minor child, Ethan Reed, when in the care of the Defendant, Thomas Reed.  
8. On multiple occasions, Ethan has reported that the Defendant consumes "special drinks" while he is in the care of the Defendant which impact the Defendant’s physical ability to safely care for him.  
9. The Defendant has exhibited signs of substance impairment while in the presence of the minor child, evidenced by an incident captured on video wherein the Defendant was visibly impaired and stumbling while removing Ethan from a vehicle late at night.  
10. A concerned neighbor provided the Plaintiff with video evidence of this incident, which occurred during one of the Defendant’s designated parenting times.  
11. Ethan’s teachers at [Ethan’s School Name] have noted that he often appears tired and unfocused on Monday mornings, following weekends spent with the Defendant.  
12. The Plaintiff is deeply concerned that the Defendant’s behavior and potential substance abuse issues pose a direct risk to Ethan’s safety and emotional well-being, particularly when the Defendant is responsible for Ethan overnight.  
13. The circumstances described herein represent a material and substantial change in circumstances since the time of the original custody order that was unknown to the Plaintiff at the time of the order’s entry.

### **APPLICABLE LAW AND ARGUMENT**  

14. Massachusetts law permits modification of a custody order when there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances making the existing order no longer in the best interest of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; **Schechter v. Schechter**, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015).  
15. A parent’s substance abuse or conduct that poses a risk to a child is a recognized basis for modifying custody or visitation. See **Blixt v. Blixt**, 437 Mass. 649 (2002); **Murray v. Super**, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 146 (2015).  
16. The best interest of the child is the paramount consideration in custody determinations. See **Custody of Kali**, 439 Mass. 834 (2003); G.L. c. 208, § 31.  
17. This Court has the discretion to impose conditions on the Defendant’s visitation or custody, such as supervised visitation, if such conditions are deemed necessary to protect the well-being of the minor child. See **Guardianship of Vaughn**, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).  
18. Safety concerns surrounding overnight parenting time can warrant a modification to restrict or terminate overnights. See **Hunter v. Rose**, 463 Mass. 488 (2012); **Pizzino v. Miller**, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865 (2006).  
19. The presentation of credible concerns for the child’s safety compels this Court to act to modify visitation terms in accordance with the child’s best interest. See **Smith v. McDonald**, 458 Mass. 540 (2010).

### **RELIEF REQUESTED**  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Modify the current custody and visitation order such that the Defendant’s parenting time is revised to include conditions ensuring the safety and well-being of Ethan Reed, as follows:  
   a. Require that the Defendant’s parenting time, especially overnight visits, be supervised by a neutral third party or professional agency; or  
   b. Alternatively, impose reasonable conditions, including but not limited to restricting the Defendant from consuming alcohol or substances during parenting time and installing alcohol-monitoring devices.  
2. Such other relief as this Honorable Court deems necessary and just.
