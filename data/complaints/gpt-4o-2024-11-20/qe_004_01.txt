**COMPLAINT**  

Plaintiff Maria Thompson ("Plaintiff") hereby files this Complaint against Defendant John Carter ("Defendant"), and in support thereof alleges as follows:

---

### **INTRODUCTION**

This is an action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law, arising out of Defendant's failure to take adequate and necessary measures to address a rodent infestation at Plaintiff's rented apartment. Defendant's failure to provide a safe and habitable living environment has deprived Plaintiff of her statutory and contractual rights to quiet enjoyment of her home, in violation of Massachusetts General Laws and relevant jurisprudence.

---

### **PARTIES**

1. **Plaintiff Maria Thompson** is a resident of Worcester, Massachusetts, who rents an apartment located at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01603.  
   
2. **Defendant John Carter** is the owner and landlord of the premises located at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, MA 01603. Upon information and belief, Defendant resides in Massachusetts.

### **JURISDICTION AND VENUE**

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 218, § 19, as the amount in controversy is less than $25,000.  

4. Venue is proper in this Court because the premises at issue are located in Worcester, Massachusetts, and the Defendant conducts business in Worcester.

### **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

5. Plaintiff began renting the apartment at 123 Elm Street, Worcester, MA, from Defendant on June 1, 2022, under a lease agreement in which Plaintiff agreed to pay $1,200 in monthly rent.  

6. Plaintiff has complied with all her obligations under the lease, including the payment of rent in a timely manner.  

7. Beginning approximately three months ago, in or about September 2025, Plaintiff began noticing mouse droppings in her kitchen.  

8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the rodent issue. Defendant's initial response was to place a few traps, which caught two mice.  

9. Despite this limited intervention, the rodent infestation persisted. Plaintiff continued to find mouse droppings regularly, causing her significant distress and forcing her to discard approximately $200 worth of contaminated food.  

10. At Plaintiff’s request, Defendant hired an exterminator for a singular visit. The exterminator informed Plaintiff that the building required more comprehensive treatment to address the infestation, but Defendant refused to authorize further measures, citing cost concerns.

11. Defendant also told Plaintiff that rodent problems were "normal for older buildings" and suggested that Plaintiff should be more diligent about keeping her kitchen clean.  

12. Plaintiff maintains a clean and sanitary apartment and denies that this issue is caused by any lack of cleanliness on her part.  

13. Plaintiff has taken several steps to attempt to mitigate the problem, including purchasing $80 worth of sealed plastic containers for her food storage. Nonetheless, the problem has persisted, and mouse droppings continue to appear on a weekly basis.  

14. The ongoing rodent infestation has caused Plaintiff significant distress and anxiety, rendering her unable to use and enjoy her kitchen and depriving her of the quiet enjoyment of her rental property.  

15. Defendant's refusal to take adequate corrective measures constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

16. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's breach, Plaintiff has suffered financial loss, emotional distress, and deprivation of the full use of her home.

### **CAUSES OF ACTION**  

#### **COUNT I – Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  

17. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation in Paragraphs 1 through 16 as if fully set forth herein.  

18. Under Massachusetts General Laws c. 186, § 14, a landlord who directly or indirectly interferes with a tenant's quiet enjoyment of their rental property is liable for damages and subject to other remedies.  

19. The covenant of quiet enjoyment imposes a statutory obligation on landlords to ensure tenants can use and enjoy their leased premises free from substantial interference. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 102-03 (1982).  

20. Defendant has failed to provide sufficient pest control services to effectively eliminate the ongoing rodent infestation at 123 Elm Street, despite Plaintiff’s repeated notifications.  

21. Defendant's failure to take reasonable measures to resolve the infestation constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff's legal right to quiet enjoyment of her home, as recognized in *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273, 284 (1994).  

22. Defendant’s insufficient response to the rodent issue further demonstrates a willful and knowing disregard of the obligations imposed on landlords under Massachusetts law, warranting recovery by Plaintiff. See *Haddad v. Gonzalez*, 410 Mass. 855, 871-72 (1991).  

23. As a direct result of Defendant's actions and omissions, Plaintiff has suffered monetary damages, emotional distress, and diminished habitability of the premises.

### **PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:  

1. An award of damages in the amount of at least $280 for monetary losses directly resulting from Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;  

2. Statutory damages pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14, including three months' rent or actual damages, whichever is greater;  

3. Attorneys’ fees and costs, as permitted by G.L. c. 186, § 14, although Plaintiff currently represents herself pro se;  

4. Any other relief this Court deems just and equitable.

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.
