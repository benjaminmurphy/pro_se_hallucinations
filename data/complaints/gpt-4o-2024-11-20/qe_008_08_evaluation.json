The court explicitly situates \u00a7 14 within a body of Massachusetts statutes and cases imposing duties on landlords to provide safe and sanitary housing, and affirms that liability for quiet enjoyment can be based on the landlord\u2019s reckless failure to maintain habitable, code-compliant premises. Although the quiet enjoyment damages award was vacated as duplicative, the court\u2019s reasoning clearly recognizes such liability in factual circumstances involving unsafe and unsanitary conditions.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cSection 14 belongs to a body of statutes establishing tenants\u2019 remedies against landlords who fail to provide safe and sanitary housing. \u2026 These statutes are designed to facilitate enforcement of State housing regulations and to provide relief for tenants deprived of decent homes. \u2026 The water in Solomon\u2019s apartment was a preventable situation, and one that Gem had a duty to prevent. See 105 Code Mass. Regs. 410.500; Crowell v. McCaffrey\u2026; Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway\u2026. The jury found \u2026 that the water interfered with Solomon\u2019s quiet enjoyment of her apartment. Therefore, Gem is liable under G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14.\u201d"

      "support_confidence": "high",
      "support_reasoning": "The opinion does not say that Massachusetts courts have repeatedly held landlords liable for breaches of quiet enjoyment in similar factual contexts. Instead, it narrows liability by holding that a mere statutory lead paint violation, without proof of at least negligence and notice, is not enough to constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. While it cites earlier cases (Simon, Cruz, Darmetko, Dorgan) as examples where defects and habitability issues led to \u00a7 14 liability, this case itself clarifies that additional landlord fault is required, undermining any characterization of automatic or strict liability for failure to provide safe and habitable premises.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cToday we make clear what was implicit in those rulings: to support the imposition of liability under the quiet enjoyment statute, there must be a showing of at least negligent conduct by a landlord and violation of the lead paint statute alone is not sufficient to prove such negligence. Stated differently, to obtain relief under \u00a7 14 for a claim of lead paint poisoning it must be demonstrated that the landlord had notice of or reason to know of the presence of lead and failed to take appropriate corrective measures.\u201d"

The opinion also expressly narrows the warranty of habitability to physical conditions, rejecting an argument that security obligations fall under that warranty. Thus, it cannot accurately be cited for the broader, repeated-holdings proposition stated.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cWe conclude that the judge erred in granting summary judgment for the defendant on the plaintiffs\u2019 claim of violation of G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14. There must be a trial to determine what, if any, measures the defendant has taken to remove nontenants engaged in unlawful activity and to determine the seriousness or substantiality of the interference with the tenancies. If the defendant has taken no action or inadequate action\u2026 then the plaintiffs will be entitled to judgment\u2026.\u201d"
