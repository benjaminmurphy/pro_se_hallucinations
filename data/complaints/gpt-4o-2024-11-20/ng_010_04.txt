### **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
5. Defendant owns and resides at the property located at 123 Maple Street, Pittsfield, MA 01201 ("the Property").  
6. Situated on the Property is an aging maple tree with multiple large branches that extend over the public sidewalk adjacent to the property.  
7. For months prior to July 15, 2023, a major branch of the maple tree exhibited visible signs of serious deterioration. The branch was cracked, sagging, and posed an obvious danger to pedestrians walking beneath it.  
8. Upon information and belief, Defendant was aware of the hazardous condition of the branch. Neighbors and others in the area had observed the condition of the branch and warned Defendant of the danger, urging him to consult with an arborist or remove the branch.  
9. Despite being aware of the dangerous condition of the branch and its potential to cause harm, Defendant neglected to take any reasonable steps to remedy the situation. Defendant ignored warnings and stated that he would "deal with it in the spring," but failed to act.  
10. On or about July 15, 2023, during a routine summer rainstorm with no extraordinary wind or extreme conditions, the damaged branch snapped and fell onto the sidewalk directly below.  
11. At approximately 5:30 PM on July 15, 2023, Plaintiff was walking on the public sidewalk adjacent to the Property while carrying grocery bags when the broken branch fell directly onto her, striking her shoulder and back and knocking her to the ground.  
12. As a result of the incident, Plaintiff sustained a shoulder strain, multiple bruises, and associated pain and suffering.  
13. Following the incident, Plaintiff sought medical attention and incurred medical expenses totaling approximately $3,500.  
14. Plaintiff was unable to perform her duties at work for one week following the incident, resulting in lost wages of approximately $600.  
15. Defendant’s failure to inspect, mitigate, or remove the hazardous branch constituted a substantial and unjustified risk that led directly to Plaintiff’s injuries.

### **CAUSE OF ACTION – NEGLIGENCE**  
16. Plaintiff incorporates by reference each of the allegations set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 15 of this Complaint as though fully stated herein.  
17. Defendant owed a duty to the general public, including Plaintiff, to maintain his property in a reasonably safe condition so as to prevent foreseeable harm to others. See *Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.*, 457 Mass. 368 (2010).  
18. Defendant, as a homeowner, had a duty to inspect, repair, and/or remove hazards existing on his property, including the damaged tree branch, that posed a risk of injury to pedestrians using the adjacent public sidewalk. See *Souza v. Northeast Gas Co.*, 281 Mass. 502 (1933); *Pereira v. Gloucester Community Arts Charter School*, 100 Mass. App. Ct. 125 (2021).  
19. Defendant negligently failed to act with reasonable care by:  
   a. Failing to inspect the dangerous tree branch despite its visibly deteriorated condition;  
   b. Failing to consult an arborist or professional to evaluate the hazardous branch;  
   c. Failing to take reasonable steps to mitigate the danger posed by the branch, such as pruning or removing it; and  
   d. Ignoring repeated warnings from neighbors and others regarding the unsafe condition of the branch.  
20. Defendant's breach of the standard of care created an unreasonable risk of harm, which was reasonably foreseeable given the visible condition of the tree branch and its proximity to a public sidewalk. See *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973); *Vintimilla v. Maksimowicz*, 80 Mass. App. Ct. 934 (2011).  
21. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff suffered physical injuries, including a shoulder strain and bruises, as well as financial and emotional damages, including medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering. See *Ward v. Temple Presby. Church*, 89 Mass. App. Ct. 1132 (2016).

### **DAMAGES**  
22. Plaintiff has incurred medical expenses in the amount of approximately $3,500 as a result of Defendant’s negligence.  
23. Plaintiff has lost wages in the amount of approximately $600 due to her inability to work immediately following the incident.  
24. Plaintiff has experienced pain, suffering, and emotional distress as a result of the injuries caused by the falling branch and Defendant’s failure to address the hazardous condition.  

---

### **PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment in her favor and against the Defendant for the following relief:  
1. An award of damages to compensate Plaintiff for her medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering in an amount to be determined at trial;  
2. Prejudgment interest, costs, and reasonable attorneys’ fees, pursuant to G.L. c. 231, § 6B;
