She made detailed written findings that their current schools were superior, that uprooting the children would be difficult for them, that the move would impair the father\u2019s parenting to the detriment of their interests\u2026.\u201d"

It does not discuss modification of an existing custody or visitation order based on relocation, nor does it characterize relocation or geographic distance as a \u201cmaterial change in circumstances\u201d for purposes of post-judgment modification.

Unless one is to apply a fixed but arbitrary rule, the issue can be resolved only on a case by case basis. The effect on the child of any removal is most important.

While it briefly notes that removal might \u2018interrupt\u2019 the child\u2019s education, the Appeals Court rejects that as a sufficient basis to deny removal and does not articulate any general rule that parenting time schedules interfering with routine, school, or activities are contrary to a child\u2019s best interests.

The evidence indicates that such removal would be disruptive to this child\u2019s life.\u201d We first note that it was not the mother\u2019s burden to provide evidence of improvement, but that the factors must be considered collectively."
