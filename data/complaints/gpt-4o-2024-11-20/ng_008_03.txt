**IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

7. On or about July 15, 2023, Plaintiff Jessica Harper was a customer lawfully present at Defendant Quincy Dine-In’s restaurant located at 245 Washington Street, Quincy, MA 02169.  

8. While Plaintiff was dining at the restaurant, a server employed by Defendant dropped a tray containing multiple water glasses in the hallway leading from the kitchen to the dining room.  

9. Although the server promptly picked up the broken glass, the floor was left wet and covered with water and ice.  

10. The server stated that she would "be right back with a mop" but failed to promptly return to clean the water or ice.  

11. No signs, cones, or other warnings were placed in or around the wet area to alert patrons to the dangerous condition.  

12. Approximately ten minutes later, Plaintiff walked through the hallway to use the restroom.  

13. Despite exercising reasonable caution, Plaintiff slipped on the wet and icy floor, falling and twisting her knee.  

14. Plaintiff immediately experienced pain in her knee and sought medical attention at an urgent care facility, where she was diagnosed with a sprained knee.  

15. Plaintiff was prescribed a knee brace and was required to undergo weeks of physical therapy to treat her injuries.  

16. Plaintiff incurred significant medical expenses in the approximate amount of $2,500 and lost approximately $1,200 in wages due to her inability to work during her recovery period.  

17. Plaintiff subsequently overheard multiple employees of Defendant's restaurant stating that they had been “dodging that puddle” in the hallway, demonstrating that Defendant had actual or constructive knowledge of the unsafe condition but failed to take prompt remedial action.  

18. Defendant’s failure to promptly address the hazardous condition or warn customers of its existence constituted a breach of its duty to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition.

**V. CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**Negligence**  

19. Plaintiff incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 18 of this Complaint as if fully stated herein.  

20. Defendant owed a duty of reasonable care to Plaintiff, as an invited business patron, to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn her of any conditions posing an unreasonable risk of harm. *See Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.,* 363 Mass. 165, 167 (1973); *Mounsey v. Ellard,* 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973).  

21. Defendant breached its duty of care by:  
   a. Allowing water and ice to remain on the hallway floor for an unreasonable period of time;  
   b. Failing to place any warning signs, cones, or other markers notifying patrons of the hazardous condition; and  
   c. Failing to promptly clean the wet floor or ensure the area was safe for use by customers.  

22. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff slipped and fell, suffering serious physical injuries, financial losses, and emotional distress. *See Papadopoulos v. Target Corp.,* 457 Mass. 368, 378 (2010) (holding that a premises owner has a duty to address or warn of hazards regardless of their origin).  

23. Defendant had actual or constructive notice of the hazardous condition, as evidenced by employees’ statements indicating knowledge of the puddle in the hallway. *See Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.,* 448 Mass. 780, 788–89 (2007).  

24. Defendant’s failure to take appropriate remedial action within a reasonable time after acquiring knowledge of the hazard further demonstrates breach of its duty. *See Sarkisian v. Concept Restaurants, Inc.,* 346 Mass. 31, 33 (1963).  

25. Under Massachusetts law, a property owner’s duty of care extends to the reasonable anticipation of foreseeable risks of harm to lawful visitors. Defendant’s breach was a clear violation of this standard. *See Young v. Atlantic Richfield Co.,* 400 Mass. 837, 845 (1987).  

26. Plaintiff’s injuries and damages were foreseeable consequences of Defendant’s negligence in failing to maintain its premises in a safe condition. *See Cimino v. Milford Keg, Inc.,* 385 Mass. 323, 332 (1982).  

27. Defendant's negligence was the proximate cause of the injuries and losses sustained by Plaintiff. *See Correia v. McDonald’s Corp.,* 36 Mass. App. Ct. 903, 904 (1994).

**VI. DAMAGES**  

28. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained the following damages:  
   a. Medical expenses in the amount of approximately $2,500;  
   b. Lost wages in the amount of approximately $1,200;  
   c. Physical pain and suffering;  
   d. Emotional distress; and  
   e. Other damages to be proven at trial.

4. Any other relief this Court deems just and proper.
