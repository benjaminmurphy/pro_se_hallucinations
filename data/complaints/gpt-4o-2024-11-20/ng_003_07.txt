CIVIL ACTION NO. _____________  

**Jordan Patel,**  
                    Plaintiff,  

v.  

**Home Goods Warehouse,**  
                    Defendant.  

**COMPLAINT**  

**PARTIES**  

1. The Plaintiff, Jordan Patel ("Plaintiff"), is an individual residing in Massachusetts.  
2. The Defendant, Home Goods Warehouse ("Defendant"), is a corporation duly organized and incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, with a principal place of business located at 110 Market Street, Lowell, MA 01852.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to M.G.L. c. 212, § 3, which grants Superior Courts jurisdiction over civil actions for damages above $50,000.  
4. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to M.G.L. c. 223, § 1, as the events giving rise to this Complaint occurred in Middlesex County.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

5. On or about August 15, 2023, the Plaintiff was lawfully on the premises of the Defendant’s store, located at 110 Market Street, Lowell, MA 01852, as an invitee for the purpose of shopping for home goods.  
6. While browsing a store aisle designated for kitchen appliances, the Plaintiff encountered a display in which multiple, heavy boxes of appliances, including toaster ovens, were improperly stacked to a height of five or six boxes. These boxes were not secured by straps, barriers, or other safety measures.  
7. A third party, another customer, bumped into a lower shelf in the same aisle with a shopping cart.  
8. This reasonable and foreseeable contact caused a heavy box containing a toaster oven to fall from the top of the display onto the Plaintiff's head and shoulder.  
9. The Plaintiff immediately experienced dizziness and a headache, and subsequently developed worsening symptoms.  
10. An employee of the Defendant, upon being notified of the incident, completed an incident report and offered the Plaintiff a coupon as compensation.  
11. Later that evening, the Plaintiff sought emergency medical care, where a medical provider diagnosed the Plaintiff with a mild concussion and a shoulder strain.  
12. As a result of the Defendant's negligence, the Plaintiff incurred medical expenses of approximately $1,800 and lost wages of approximately $600 due to missed work as a delivery driver.  
13. Additionally, the Plaintiff experienced pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and was unable to participate in regular recreational activities, such as a weekly soccer league, for approximately one month.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**(Negligence)**  

14. The Plaintiff incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 13 of this Complaint as if fully stated herein.  
15. At all times relevant hereto, the Defendant owed a duty of care to the Plaintiff, as a business invitee, to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition, inspect its premises for dangerous conditions, and warn invitees of any hazardous conditions about which it had actual or constructive knowledge.  
16. The Defendant breached its duty of care by failing to:  
   a. Adequately secure heavy, stacked boxes in its store aisles to prevent them from falling;  
   b. Take reasonable precautions, such as using straps, guards, or other barriers, to stabilize the stacked boxes;  
   c. Properly inspect and correct the hazardous stacking arrangement in the aisle where the Plaintiff was injured; and  
   d. Warn the Plaintiff and other invitees of the hazardous condition of the improperly stacked boxes.  
17. The Defendant knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known that the boxes in question were unsafely stacked, creating an unreasonable risk of harm to store customers.  
18. As a direct and proximate result of the Defendant's negligence, the Plaintiff sustained physical injuries, including but not limited to a mild concussion and shoulder strain, incurred medical expenses, lost wages, and endured pain and suffering.  
19. The Defendant’s acts and omissions were the legal cause of the Plaintiff’s injuries and damages.  

**LEGAL AUTHORITIES**  

20. The duty owed to business invitees is well established in Massachusetts law. See, e.g., **Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., 363 Mass. 165, 167 (1973)** ("A possessor of land has a duty to use reasonable care to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition for lawful visitors.").  
21. In **Papadopoulos v. Target Corp., 457 Mass. 368, 372 (2010)**, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts held that property owners have an obligation to "prevent injury to lawful entrants caused by dangerous conditions on their property."  
22. The Defendant is liable under the principle of premises liability, as articulated in **Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 695 (1973)**, which held that landowners owe a duty of reasonable care to lawful visitors.  
23. A landowner’s duty extends to conducting reasonable inspections and remedying hazards, as noted in **Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc., 448 Mass. 780, 781 (2007)**.  
24. In **Young v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 400 Mass. 837, 841 (1987)**, the Court affirmed that a failure to maintain premises in a safe condition can result in liability for foreseeable injuries.  
25. The allegations in this Complaint are consistent with the standard of care established by cases such as **Michnik-Zilberman v. Gordon's Liquor, Inc., 390 Mass. 6, 11 (1983)**, where the Court found property owners liable for improperly stacked inventory.  
26. Additionally, under **Glick v. Prince Italian Foods of Saugus, Inc., 25 Mass. App. Ct. 901, 901-02 (1987)**, a business owner can be liable when the foreseeable actions of third parties contribute to a hazardous condition.  
27. Pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 231, § 85**, the comparative fault statute, the Plaintiff’s conduct was not negligent, and the Defendant bore exclusive responsibility for the unsafe conditions.  

**DAMAGES**  

28. As a result of the Defendant’s negligence, the Plaintiff has sustained damages, including but not limited to:  
   a. Medical expenses in the amount of approximately $1,800;  
   b. Lost wages in the amount of approximately $600;  
   c. Pain and suffering;  
   d. Loss of enjoyment of life; and  
   e. Other damages to be proven at trial.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Enter judgment in favor of the Plaintiff and against the Defendant;  
2. Award the Plaintiff damages in an amount to be determined at trial, including but not limited to compensatory damages, medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering;  
3. Award interest, costs, and attorney’s fees to the extent permitted by law; and  
4. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.  

Respectfully submitted,
