It does not discuss negligence, duty, breach, or foreseeability as elements of a negligence claim. Nothing in the holding or reasoning treats foreseeability as a key factor in establishing negligence, so citing this case for that proposition would be inaccurate.",

The issue involves a question of fundamental fairness in a due process sense. Although the concept underlying the prohibition against ex post facto laws is also based on fundamental fairness, we see no violation of the prohibition against ex post facto laws."

The SJC holds that a landowner is not relieved from remedying such an open and obvious danger where the landowner can and should anticipate that it will cause physical harm, and reverses because the jury were not allowed to consider this duty-to-remedy theory.
