The court then discusses Massachusetts\u2019 traditional rule that a store owner must maintain its property in a reasonably safe condition and may be liable when it has actual or constructive notice of dangerous conditions. This directly supports the stated proposition about a landowner\u2019s duty of reasonable care to invitees to maintain safe premises and warn of unreasonably dangerous conditions it knew or should have known about, even though the case then modifies how notice can be shown via the mode-of-operation doctrine.",
