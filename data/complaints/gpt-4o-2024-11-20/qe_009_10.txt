Plaintiff,  
   
v.  

**Thomas Jenkins,**  
Defendant.  

**CIVIL ACTION NO.: [________]**  

**COMPLAINT**  

**INTRODUCTION**  
This is an action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law. Plaintiff Jessica Hartman, a residential tenant, has suffered substantial interference with her use and enjoyment of her leased apartment caused by Defendant Thomas Jenkins, her landlord. Specifically, Defendant has failed to remedy an electrical defect in one of the Plaintiff’s bedrooms, depriving her of access to essential amenities and functionality in the space. This ongoing problem has caused Plaintiff significant personal and financial harm.  

This claim is brought pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws c. 186, § 14, which protects tenants from substantial and unreasonable interference with their quiet enjoyment of their homes and allows recovery of actual damages or three times the tenant’s rent, whichever is greater.  

**PARTIES**  
1. Plaintiff Jessica Hartman is a resident of Springfield, Massachusetts, who resides at 123 Elm Street, Apartment [#], Springfield, MA 01105.  
2. Defendant Thomas Jenkins is, upon information and belief, the owner and landlord of the residential property located at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, MA 01105.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws c. 218, § 19.  
4. Venue is proper in this District Court under Mass. Gen. Laws c. 223, § 1, as the leased property, the underlying events, and the parties are located within Hampden County.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
5. On May 1, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant to rent a two-bedroom apartment at 123 Elm Street, Springfield, MA 01105, for $1,600 per month.  
6. Defendant, as landlord, is obligated to maintain the premises in a condition fit for human habitation and free of conditions substantially interfering with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the premises.  
7. Beginning approximately six weeks prior to the filing of this Complaint, one of the two bedrooms in Plaintiff's unit—utilized by Plaintiff as a home office—experienced a complete electrical failure, rendering all outlets and the overhead light in that room unusable.  
8. Plaintiff promptly reported the issue to Defendant.  
9. Defendant sent an electrician to evaluate the issue, who determined that a substantial repair involving the building’s old wiring was necessary.  
10. Despite knowledge of the problem and the electrician’s determination, Defendant failed to make timely repairs, leaving the defect unresolved for over six weeks.  
11. As a result, Plaintiff has been unable to use the affected room for its intended purpose or for any other purpose.  
12. Plaintiff has had to vacate the space she used for work and relocate her professional activities to coffee shops, where she incurs daily expenses of approximately $15 for food and beverages.  
13. Plaintiff has additionally been forced to pay $150 per month for a coworking space membership in light of the unusable condition of her apartment.  
14. The disrepair has also caused the Plaintiff to crowd her office furniture and equipment into the living room, making the apartment disorganized and uncomfortable for daily living.  
15. Defendant has provided no timeline for completing the repairs and has unreasonably delayed addressing the issue.  
16. Defendant’s failure to act constitutes a substantial and unreasonable interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her rented premises.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (Mass. Gen. Laws c. 186, § 14)**  
17. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 16 above.  
18. Under Mass. Gen. Laws c. 186, § 14, every residential tenant in Massachusetts is entitled to the quiet enjoyment of their rental premises.  
19. In violation of this provision, Defendant’s failure to timely repair the electrical defect has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to peacefully and reasonably occupy the premises.  
20. Defendant’s delay and inaction constitute an intentional or negligent breach of Plaintiff’s statutory right to quiet enjoyment.  
21. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s actions, Plaintiff has suffered the following damages:  
    a. Economic damages, including out-of-pocket expenses for food, beverages, and coworking space fees, totaling approximately $450;  
    b. Diminished value of the leased premises during the period of disrepair; and  
    c. Emotional distress and hardship caused by the interference with her living conditions.  

22. Pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover actual damages or three times her monthly rent, whichever is greater, along with reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court grant the following relief:  
A. Award Plaintiff actual damages, in an amount to be determined at trial but not less than $450, or three times the monthly rent of $1,600, pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws c. 186, § 14;  
B. Award costs and fees incurred as a result of this litigation, including Plaintiff’s reasonable attorney’s fees, as provided by law;  
C. Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and equitable.
