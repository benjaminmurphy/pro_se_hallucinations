      "support_reasoning": "The case is primarily a tort decision about landlords\u2019 negligence liability to tenants\u2019 guests, not a warranty-of-habitability or heating-services case. However, in describing Massachusetts landlord-tenant law, the court expressly affirms that, through the implied warranty of habitability and related statutes, landlords must maintain residential premises at least to the standards of applicable housing and building codes. Those codes include essential services like heat during the heating season, so the opinion provides general authority for the broader proposition that Massachusetts law requires landlords to keep residential units habitable, though it does not specifically discuss heat.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "In the landlord-tenant field, we have held that a landlord is liable to a tenant\u2019s guest for failing to exercise due care in maintaining common passageways under the landlord\u2019s control without regard to their condition at the time of the letting. \u2026 We have also attacked the theory on which the tenant\u2019s status classification depends. In the line of cases creating and applying the implied warranty of habitability, we have overthrown the doctrine of caveat emptor and the notion that a lease is a conveyance of property. \u2026 Thus, at least to the extent required by the relevant housing and building codes, a landlord may be liable to his tenant for failing to maintain areas not under the landlord\u2019s control."

      "support_reasoning": "The opinion does not address heating services or habitability issues; it concerns whether a statutory lead paint violation, by itself, constitutes a breach of the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 14. The court holds that some degree of landlord fault (at least negligence with notice) is required for \u00a7 14 liability and that strict statutory liability alone is insufficient. While the case generally describes the fault standard under \u00a7 14, it does not specifically state that failure to provide consistent and functional heating constitutes a breach of quiet enjoyment, so it does not directly support the proposition claimed.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cToday we make clear what was implicit in those rulings: to support the imposition of liability under the quiet enjoyment statute, there must be a showing of at least negligent conduct by a landlord and violation of the lead paint statute alone is not sufficient to prove such negligence. Stated differently, to obtain relief under \u00a7 14 for a claim of lead paint poisoning it must be demonstrated that the landlord had notice of or reason to know of the presence of lead and failed to take appropriate corrective measures.\u201d"

      "support_reasoning": "The opinion does not discuss any specific financial damages suffered by the tenant, such as additional electricity costs, medical expenses, or lost wages. Instead, the court affirms findings that there was no breach of the warranty of habitability, no breach of quiet enjoyment, no retaliatory eviction, and no Chapter 93A violation, and it does not award or analyze consequential damages. Thus, it cannot be cited as authority that the defendant\u2019s actions caused the types of financial damages described in the proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Finally, in the absence of a breach of the warranty of habitability or the covenant of quiet enjoyment, and with no finding of retaliatory eviction by York, we agree with the trial judge that no violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2(a), occurred.\n...\nUpon review of all the evidence, we conclude that the trial judge did not abuse her discretion and that there was sufficient evidence to support her findings."

It does not involve landlord-tenant law, quiet enjoyment, or any discussion of civil damages for interference with use of premises or consequential damages from statutory violations. Accordingly, it cannot be cited as authority for a tenant\u2019s entitlement to damages for interference with quiet enjoyment or related consequential damages.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "This appeal involves a rape indictment returned under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 24A, which places venue for prosecution, and for punishment upon conviction, either in the county where a rape was committed or in the point of origin county, if the victim is conveyed from that origin county to another county \u201cin connection with the alleged commission of [the] crime.\u201d In effect, the statute sets dual venue for cases where there has been a conveyance of, in other words, a transportation of, the victim across county lines, so that either county may be the venue for prosecution."
