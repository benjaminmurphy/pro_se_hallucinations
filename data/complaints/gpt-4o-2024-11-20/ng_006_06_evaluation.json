Instead, the SJC holds that the evidence was insufficient, as a matter of law, to show that the defendant breached its duty of reasonable care or had actual or constructive notice of the icy condition, and therefore the defendant was entitled to judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The opinion thus affirms no actionable negligence on these facts and is authority in favor of the defense, not the plaintiff.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cAfter reviewing the evidence presented at the first trial, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict should have been allowed because the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, was not sufficient to warrant an inference that the defendant violated the duty of reasonable care that it owed to the plaintiff. \u2026 Specifically, we hold that the evidence did not warrant an inference that the defendant knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, of the icy condition that caused the plaintiff\u2019s fall.\u201d"

Instead, the court addresses evidentiary rulings, jury instructions on taxes, and the retroactive application and constitutionality of the filial consortium statute. The case therefore does not establish or analyze a general rule that the defendant\u2019s actions constitute actionable negligence; it simply leaves the negligence verdict undisturbed.",

It does not involve negligence, due care, or civil liability for personal injuries or damages. The court\u2019s reasoning is confined to statutory and historical interpretation of highway layout and discontinuance, so it does not establish any rule about failure to exercise due care creating civil liability.",

We, therefore, conclude that the judge did not err in determining that the order the commissioners entered in 1845 automatically discontinued the way shown on the plaintiffs\u2019 plan as a county road.\""
