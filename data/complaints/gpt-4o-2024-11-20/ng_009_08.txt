### FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

3. Plaintiff resides in an apartment building located at 123 Elm Street, Lynn, Massachusetts, managed and maintained by Defendant.  
4. Defendant is responsible for maintaining all common areas of the building, including ensuring that functional smoke detectors are installed and maintained in compliance with Massachusetts statutory and common law duties.  
5. Plaintiff’s apartment is located on the third floor of the building. A hallway smoke detector is located immediately outside Plaintiff’s apartment.  
6. Beginning several months before the incident described below, the smoke detector in the hallway located outside Plaintiff’s door began emitting periodic "chirping" noises, indicating a low battery.  
7. At some point before the fire in dispute, the battery was removed from the smoke detector, rendering it entirely inoperable. The removed battery was left on the adjoining hallway windowsill.    
8. Plaintiff informed Defendant on at least three separate occasions regarding the inoperable detector. Defendant repeatedly assured Plaintiff he would "take care of it," but failed to remedy the issue in a timely manner.  
9. On 2023-10-05, a kitchen fire broke out in a first-floor unit at 123 Elm Street. The fire quickly spread smoke to the upper floors, including the third floor where Plaintiff resides.  
10. Because the hallway smoke detector was non-functioning due to the Defendant's failure to maintain it, there was no audible alarm to provide an early warning of the fire or smoke.  
11. Plaintiff detected the presence of smoke only after smelling it, by which time the hallway was already filled with heavy smoke, leaving Plaintiff with limited access to emergency exits and little time to evacuate.  
12. Plaintiff attempted to escape through the heavily smoke-filled hallway and struggled with shortness of breath before finally exiting the building.  
13. Plaintiff was transported by ambulance to a hospital where she was treated for smoke inhalation. Plaintiff incurred medical expenses totaling approximately $12,000.  
14. Plaintiff was unable to work for several weeks following the fire due to health concerns and lost wages totaling approximately $2,500.  
15. Plaintiff’s personal property, including clothing, furniture, and personal belongings, was severely damaged or destroyed due to smoke and water damage resulting from the fire.  

---

### CAUSE OF ACTION: NEGLIGENCE

16. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1-15, inclusive, as though fully set forth herein.  
17. Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of reasonable care as the property manager to maintain the building in a safe condition, including ensuring that smoke detectors in common areas were functional and in compliance with applicable safety codes and Massachusetts law.  
18. Defendant had actual and constructive notice of the inoperable smoke detector for a substantial period before the fire, as Plaintiff personally notified Defendant of the issue numerous times, and the defective condition (the removed battery and chirping noise) was open and obvious to anyone on the premises.  
19. The failure of Defendant to maintain a functional smoke detector in the common hallway immediately outside Plaintiff’s apartment constitutes a breach of Defendant’s duty of care owed to Plaintiff.  
20. Defendant’s breach of duty was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries, as it prevented any audible warning of the fire, delayed Plaintiff's awareness of the danger, and forced Plaintiff to evacuate through an unsafe, smoke-filled hallway.  
21. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered substantial physical harm, emotional distress, lost wages, medical expenses, and damage to personal property.
