**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
WORCESTER DISTRICT COURT  

**JORDAN SMITH,**  
   Plaintiff,  
   v.  
**LINDA JOHNSON,**  
   Defendant.  

C.A. No.: [Leave Blank for Court Use]    

**COMPLAINT**  

**INTRODUCTION**  
1. This is an action sounding in negligence arising from injuries sustained by the Plaintiff, Jordan Smith, as a result of the Defendant, Linda Johnson, failing to use reasonable care in maintaining the sidewalk abutting her property at 45 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts.  

**PARTIES**  
2. Plaintiff, Jordan Smith, is an individual residing in Massachusetts. At all times relevant to this action, Plaintiff was lawfully on the premises of 45 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts, in the course of his work delivering groceries.  
3. Defendant, Linda Johnson, is the owner of a three-unit residential property located at 45 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts. As the property owner, Defendant had a duty of care to ensure the abutting sidewalk was reasonably safe for pedestrians, including the Plaintiff.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 218, §§ 19-21, as the amount in controversy does not exceed $50,000.  
5. Venue is proper in Worcester District Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 1 and 2, as the events giving rise to this action occurred in Worcester County.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
6. On or about February 15, 2023, Plaintiff was delivering groceries to a tenant of 45 Elm Street, Worcester, Massachusetts.  
7. The sidewalk abutting Defendant’s property was narrow and covered with a sheet of ice due to improper snow and ice removal by the Defendant, who shoveled a narrow path but failed to spread any salt, sand, or other material that would prevent ice formation.  
8. Upon information and belief, the tenants of Defendant’s property had notified her of the unsafe sidewalk via text messages and even sent her photographs of the ice. She responded that “the sun will take care of it,” reflecting her refusal to take appropriate action to remedy the hazardous condition.  
9. On the date in question, Plaintiff walked on the sidewalk abutting Defendant's property, slipped on the ice, and fell backward, striking his lower back on the ground.  
10. As a result of this fall, Plaintiff sustained injuries to his lower back, causing significant pain, limited mobility, medical expenses, and lost wages.  

**NEGLIGENCE**  
11. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations set forth above in paragraphs 1 through 10 as if fully set forth herein.  
12. Defendant owed a duty of care under G.L. c. 84, § 13 to maintain the sidewalk abutting her property in a reasonably safe condition and to remove snow and ice reasonably.  
13. Defendant breached her duty of care by failing to take reasonable measures to ensure the sidewalk was safe for pedestrians. Specifically:  
   a. Defendant failed to remove snow and ice in a safe and effective manner.  
   b. Defendant failed to apply salt, sand, or other materials to the sidewalk to prevent ice from forming.  
   c. Defendant ignored direct notifications from her tenants regarding the dangerous condition of the sidewalk.  
14. Defendant’s negligent actions and omissions created an unreasonable risk of injury to lawful users of the sidewalk, including the Plaintiff.  
15. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff slipped on the ice and sustained injuries, including but not limited to:  
   a. Injury to his lower back, resulting in pain and limited mobility.  
   b. Medical expenses in the approximate amount of $2,500.  
   c. Lost wages in the approximate amount of $1,000.  

**COUNT I: NEGLIGENCE**  
16. Defendant’s actions and omissions constitute negligence under Massachusetts law.  
17. Massachusetts law imposes a duty on property owners to ensure that sidewalks abutting their property are reasonably safe for public use. See Papadopoulos v. Target Corp., 457 Mass. 368, 933 N.E.2d 50 (2010).  
18. Under Massachusetts common law, landowners have a duty to protect invitees against unreasonable risks of harm. See Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 296 N.E.2d 50 (1973).  
19. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has held that landowners are responsible for addressing unsafe snow and ice conditions on their property or abutting sidewalks. Id.; see also Barry v. Beverly Enterprises-Mass., Inc., 418 Mass. 590, 638 N.E.2d 17 (1994).  
20. The doctrine of foreseeability applies here, as the hazardous condition created by the Defendant's failure to salt or sand the icy sidewalk was plainly foreseeable. See Davis v. Westwood Group, 420 Mass. 739, 652 N.E.2d 567 (1995).  
21. The Defendant’s failure to remedy the icy condition caused Plaintiff to slip and fall, a foreseeable harm under the circumstances. See Mastrangelo v. West End Realty Corp., 274 Mass. 451 (1931); Kulda v. Parker, 371 Mass. 582 (1976).  

**DAMAGES**  
22. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered the following damages:  
   a. Medical expenses in the approximate amount of $2,500.  
   b. Lost wages in the approximate amount of $1,000.  
   c. Pain, suffering, and emotional distress resulting from the physical injury.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment against Defendant as follows:  
1. Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, including reimbursement for medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering.  
2. Such further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

Respectfully submitted,
