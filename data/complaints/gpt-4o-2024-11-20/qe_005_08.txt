**Jordan Thompson,**  
**Plaintiff,**  
v.  
**Michael Richards,**  
**Defendant.**  

**DOCKET NO.: ___________**

**COMPLAINT**  

**I. INTRODUCTION**  

1. This is a civil action arising from Defendant Michael Richards' breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, as codified in M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, and recognized under Massachusetts common law. Plaintiff Jordan Thompson seeks damages for Defendant’s failure to take adequate steps to address excessive noise caused by tenants under Defendant’s control, resulting in severe disruption to Plaintiff’s ability to use and enjoy the subject premises.  

---

**II. PARTIES**  

2. Plaintiff Jordan Thompson is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Unit 2, Somerville, Massachusetts 02144, and has been a lawful tenant at the premises since May 1, 2022.  

3. Defendant Michael Richards is the owner and landlord of the property located at 123 Elm Street, Somerville, Massachusetts, including the second-floor apartment leased by Plaintiff and the third-floor apartment leased by tenants whose actions form the basis of this Complaint.

**III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

4. Jurisdiction is proper under M.G.L. c. 218, § 19, as the amount in controversy does not exceed $50,000, and the Somerville District Court has jurisdiction over civil matters arising in this county.  

5. Venue is proper in the Somerville District Court because the property subject to this Complaint and the events at issue are located in Somerville, Massachusetts, within this Court’s jurisdiction.

**IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

6. Plaintiff incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully restated herein.  

7. Plaintiff entered into a year-to-year lease agreement with Defendant beginning on May 1, 2022, for the second-floor apartment located at 123 Elm Street, Unit 2, Somerville, Massachusetts. Plaintiff pays $1,800 per month in rent pursuant to the lease agreement.  

8. The lease agreement includes an express or implied provision entitling Plaintiff to the covenant of quiet enjoyment, as required by M.G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

9. Approximately six months ago, new tenants moved into the third-floor apartment above Plaintiff.  

10. Since their tenancy began, the upstairs tenants have consistently created excessive noise, including but not limited to stomping, playing loud music late at night, and moving furniture after midnight, severely disrupting Plaintiff’s peaceful use and enjoyment of their home.  

11. Plaintiff has made multiple direct requests to the upstairs tenants to reduce noise levels, but these efforts have been largely ineffective as the noise persists.  

12. Plaintiff has notified Defendant of the noise issues at least five (5) or six (6) times. Defendant initially spoke to the upstairs tenants once but has since failed to take reasonable or sufficient steps to remedy the issue, stating that he “cannot control how people live.”  

13. The excessive noise has resulted in Plaintiff suffering extreme sleep deprivation, which, in turn, has caused Plaintiff to receive a written warning at work for falling asleep on the job. Plaintiff has also been prescribed sleep medication by a medical professional due to the noise-related disruption and now incurs $40 monthly in medication costs.  

14. Plaintiff purchased earplugs, a white noise machine, and rearranged their bedroom furniture in efforts to mitigate the noise, but none of these efforts have been successful.  

15. Plaintiff has suffered significant emotional distress, anxiety, and physical exhaustion due to the ongoing noise issues and Defendant’s failure to ensure compliance with the covenant of quiet enjoyment.

16. Defendant’s failure to act has rendered the premises unsuitable for the purposes for which it was rented and constitutes a violation of Plaintiff’s statutory rights under M.G.L. c. 186, § 14 and common law.

**V. CAUSE OF ACTION**  

**COUNT I – BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT (M.G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  

17. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein.  

18. The covenant of quiet enjoyment is a statutory and common-law right guaranteed to tenants under Massachusetts law pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

19. Defendant, as landlord, has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment by failing to address or remediate the excessive and unreasonable noise caused by the upstairs tenants, whose conduct interferes substantially with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the leased premises.  

20. Defendant had actual knowledge of the noise issues through Plaintiff’s repeated reports and complaints and was in a position to remedy the problems. Despite this, Defendant took no reasonable or meaningful action to ensure compliance with the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  

21. Defendant’s breach has caused harm to Plaintiff, including but not limited to sleep deprivation, emotional distress, physical exhaustion, adverse employment consequences, and medical expenses.  

22. Under Massachusetts law, including M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover damages for the harm caused by Defendant’s breach.  

23. Plaintiff’s damages are estimated at $3,600, which includes medical expenses, costs incurred to address the noise, lost use and enjoyment of the premises, and emotional distress.  

24. Defendant’s actions, or lack thereof, represent a clear violation of the implied duties of a landlord under Massachusetts law, as recognized in *Dartmouth v. Silva*, 325 Mass. 594 (1950) and related authorities.  

---

**VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jordan Thompson respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment against Defendant Michael Richards and grant the following relief:  

1. An award of compensatory damages in the amount of $3,600 to Plaintiff;  

2. An award of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, as permitted under M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, should Plaintiff later retain legal counsel;  

3. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

---

**JURY DEMAND**  

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,
