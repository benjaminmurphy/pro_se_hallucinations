**SARA MITCHELL,**  
    Plaintiff,  

v.  

**KYLE THOMPSON,**  
    Defendant.  

Docket No. ___________________  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Sara Mitchell, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, and respectfully requests that this Honorable Court modify the existing custody order entered on March 15, 2022, by the Bristol County Probate and Family Court. In support thereof, the Plaintiff alleges as follows:

### PARTIES  
1. The Plaintiff, Sara Mitchell ("Plaintiff"), resides in Fall River, Massachusetts.  
2. The Defendant, Kyle Thompson ("Defendant"), resides in Taunton, Massachusetts.  
3. The parties are the parents of two minor children:  
    - Emma Thompson, born on September 8, 2015, and  
    - Liam Thompson, born on October 1, 2017 (together, the "Children").  

### JURISDICTION AND VENUE  
4. This Honorable Court has jurisdiction to hear and decide matters concerning the modification of custody orders pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, as the parties and children reside within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  
5. Venue is proper in the Bristol County Probate and Family Court under G.L. c. 209C, § 3, where the earlier judgment was entered.  

### FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS SUPPORTING MODIFICATION  
6. The current custody order, entered on March 15, 2022, grants joint legal custody of the Children to the parties, with the Children primarily residing with the Plaintiff and parenting time for the Defendant on alternating weekends.  
7. The current order also requires the parties to support the Children’s relationship with both parents and refrain from disparaging one another in front of the Children.  
8. Since the entry of the custody order, there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances, including but not limited to the following:  

   a. The Defendant has repeatedly violated the provision requiring mutual agreement regarding decisions affecting the welfare of the Children by unilaterally enrolling the Children in extracurricular activities that fall during the Plaintiff’s parenting time without consulting the Plaintiff.  
   b. The Defendant’s actions have caused the Children to experience stress, as the Defendant has blamed the Plaintiff for alleged failures to attend these activities, leading them to believe the Plaintiff is at fault.  
   c. The Defendant has made disparaging comments about the Plaintiff to the Children, including stating that the Plaintiff is “selfish” and does not “really love them.” Such comments are detrimental to the emotional well-being of the Children and a violation of the prior order.  
   d. The Plaintiff’s younger child, Liam, has begun experiencing frequent stomach aches and symptoms of anxiety specifically on transition days between homes, suggesting elevated emotional distress.  

9. It is in the best interests of the Children for the custody arrangement to be modified so that:  
   a. The Children reside primarily with the Plaintiff;  
   b. The Defendant’s parenting time is modified to support a more stable and consistent schedule that prioritizes the Children’s emotional health and well-being; and  
   c. Clearer guidelines are established regarding extracurricular activity scheduling and decision-making to avoid future conflict.  

### REQUEST FOR MODIFICATION  
10. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, a court may modify an existing custody order upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances that affects the best interests of the child. See *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488 (2012).  
11. The material changes described above, including the Defendant’s unilateral scheduling decisions, disparaging comments, and the Children’s resulting emotional distress, create a situation that no longer serves the best interests of the Children under the current custody arrangement. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006); *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981).  
12. Furthermore, the Children’s best interests require the avoidance of parental conflict and the creation of conditions that foster stability. See *Hodgman v. Hodgman*, 76 Mass. App. Ct. 14 (2009); *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).  
13. G.L. c. 208, § 28 explicitly requires that modifications prioritize the child’s needs over the interests or convenience of a parent. See also *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985), emphasizing the child’s emotional well-being and stability as paramount.  

### PRAYERS FOR RELIEF  
WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Modify the current custody order to grant the Plaintiff sole legal custody and establish the Plaintiff’s home as the primary residence of the Children;  
2. Modify the parenting schedule to provide the Defendant consistent, minor parenting time that minimizes transitions and prioritizes the Children’s emotional health;  
3. Enter a clear order concerning extracurricular activity scheduling that requires mutual decision-making or express written communication and consent between the parties before commitments are made;  
4. Prohibit both parties from making disparaging remarks about the other parent in the Children’s presence;  
5. Order the Defendant to participate in appropriate co-parenting classes or counseling to improve future communication and decision-making with the Plaintiff;  
6. Such other relief as this Honorable Court deems just and proper.  

Respectfully submitted,  

**Sara Mitchell**  
Plaintiff, Pro Se
