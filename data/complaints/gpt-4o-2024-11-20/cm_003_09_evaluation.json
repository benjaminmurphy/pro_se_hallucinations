In a case such as this, the father\u2019s constitutional rights as a parent require that the judge considering a request for removal take into account the potential for the father to seek a resumption of visitation."

The court then applies that standard to resolve the custody dispute in this case, affirming that custody under G.L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10(a) is to be decided according to the child\u2019s best interests.",
