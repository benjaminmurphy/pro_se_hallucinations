### COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  
WORCESTER DISTRICT COURT  

**Emily Johnson,**  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**Michael Smith,**  
Defendant.  

Civil Action No.: _____________  

### COMPLAINT  

**Introduction**  

1. This is an action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts law, G.L. c. 186, § 14, and related landlord-tenant law. Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, seeks damages and other relief related to Defendant, Michael Smith’s failure to adequately address a persistent mouse infestation in Plaintiff’s rental unit.  

**Parties**  

2. Plaintiff, Emily Johnson, resides at 45 Brook Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01605, where she has been a tenant of Defendant since May 1, 2022.  
3. Defendant, Michael Smith, is the owner and landlord of the residential rental unit located at 45 Brook Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01605.  

**Jurisdiction and Venue**  

4. This Court has jurisdiction over the claims in this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14 and G.L. c. 231.  
5. Venue is proper in this Court because the rental unit is located in Worcester, Massachusetts, and the Defendant conducts business in this jurisdiction.  

**Factual Allegations**  

6. Plaintiff has leased her apartment from Defendant since May 1, 2022, paying $1,200 per month in rent in accordance with the lease agreement (hereinafter, the "Premises").  
7. Beginning in or around September 2025, Plaintiff began noticing persistent signs of a mouse infestation in her unit, including frequent mouse droppings in the kitchen.  
8. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the infestation, seeking remediation consistent with Defendant's legal obligations under Massachusetts law.  
9. In response, Defendant took minimal remedial action, such as placing a few traps. These measures proved ineffective in addressing the infestation.  
10. Defendant later hired an exterminator for a single visit only. Following this visit, the exterminator informed Plaintiff that the building required a more comprehensive pest control approach to effectively mitigate the problem. Defendant refused to take any further action.  
11. Defendant dismissed Plaintiff’s ongoing concerns, stating that the presence of rodents in older buildings is "normal" and implying that Plaintiff was responsible for their continued presence by not maintaining a clean kitchen.  
12. Plaintiff has kept her kitchen clean and has taken further measures to mitigate the infestation by purchasing plastic food storage containers at her own expense, totaling approximately $80, and disposing of food products contaminated by rodent activity, resulting in a loss of approximately $200 in groceries.  
13. Despite Plaintiff’s efforts, rodent droppings continue to appear regularly. Plaintiff remains unable to enjoy the full use and comfort of her home, particularly her kitchen, due to the health and safety risks posed by the infestation.  
14. Plaintiff has suffered economic losses, emotional distress, and significant anxiety related to Defendant’s failure to remedy the infestation.  

**Count I: Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  

15. Plaintiff restates and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth herein.  
16. Under Massachusetts law, G.L. c. 186, § 14, every residential lease includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, and any substantial interference with a tenant's use and enjoyment of the premises constitutes a breach of this covenant.  
17. The presence of a persistent rodent infestation constitutes a substantial interference with the Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the premises. See *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273, 281 (1994) (holding that substantial and recurring interferences may violate the covenant of quiet enjoyment).  
18. Defendant was aware of the infestation and failed to take reasonable steps to address it effectively, thereby violating Plaintiff’s rights under G.L. c. 186, § 14.  
19. Defendant’s failure to resolve the infestation in good faith constitutes a willful or knowing violation of the statute, entitling Plaintiff to statutory damages and attorneys’ fees. See *Simon v. Solomon*, 385 Mass. 91, 100 (1982) (noting that a willful or knowing breach of G.L. c. 186, § 14 results in liability for enhanced damages).  

**Causes of Action**  

**Count I: Violation of G.L. c. 186, § 14 (Breach of Quiet Enjoyment)**  

20. Plaintiff restates each and every allegation set forth above and incorporates them by reference herein.  
21. Plaintiff has been substantially deprived of her quiet enjoyment of the premises as a result of Defendant's failure to address the rodent infestation.  

**Prayer for Relief**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:  

a. Actual damages in the amount of $280 or such greater amount as may be proven at trial, plus treble damages as permitted under G.L. c. 186, § 14;  
b. Reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14;  
c. Such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.  

**Jury Demand**  
Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

**Respectfully Submitted,**
