**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT DEPARTMENT**  
**MIDDLESEX COUNTY, DOCKET NO. [INSERT YOUR CASE NUMBER]**

**SARAH JOHNSON**, Plaintiff  
v.  
**MARK THOMPSON**, Defendant  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

**INTRODUCTION**

The Plaintiff, Sarah Johnson, respectfully submits this Complaint for Modification of the custody order issued by the Middlesex Probate and Family Court on April 15, 2021, alleging that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances that renders the current custody arrangement no longer in the best interests of the parties’ minor child, Emily Johnson, age 8. The Plaintiff requests that the Court issue an order eliminating the midweek overnight visitation schedule due to long travel distances and modifying the weekend schedule accordingly.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**

1. The Plaintiff, Sarah Johnson, is the mother of the minor child, Emily Johnson, age 8 (hereinafter “the Child”), and resides in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

2. The Defendant, Mark Thompson, is the father of the Child and previously resided in close proximity to the Plaintiff in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Defendant has recently indicated his intent to relocate to New Hampshire due to a new employment opportunity.

3. Pursuant to the custody order issued on April 15, 2021, the Plaintiff was granted primary physical custody of the Child, with the Defendant having parenting time on Wednesdays and every other weekend.

4. The existing custody arrangement assumes that both parties reside near each other and that the Child attends her local school without disruption.

5. The Defendant’s decision to relocate to New Hampshire will necessitate round-trip travel of approximately ninety (90) minutes each way for midweek visitation, resulting in the Child going to bed late and having to wake up extremely early for her return to school the following day.

6. The Child has begun expressing anxiety about the anticipated long drives and the disruption to her after-school schedule, including her participation in extracurricular activities.

7. The current custody arrangement is no longer practical and does not reflect the needs and best interests of the Child given the increased geographic distance and its impact on her wellbeing.

8. The Plaintiff has proposed modifications to the parenting schedule that would eliminate the midweek overnight visitation and adjust weekend visitation to better accommodate the travel demands while preserving meaningful time with the Defendant. The Defendant has refused this proposal.

**JURISDICTION**

9. Pursuant to G.L. c. 209C, § 20, this Court retains jurisdiction to modify orders concerning custody and parenting time upon a showing of a material change in circumstances and that the proposed modification is in the best interests of the Child.

10. Venue is proper in Middlesex County Probate and Family Court, where the original custody order was issued, and where the Plaintiff and the Child reside.

**LEGAL STANDARD AND REQUEST FOR RELIEF**

11. Under Massachusetts law, custody orders may be modified upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances, and the court must determine whether the requested modification serves the best interests of the child. G.L. c. 208, § 28; Custody of Kali, 439 Mass. 834, 840 (2003).

12. A proposed relocation by one parent and the associated impacts on the parenting schedule are recognized as a material change in circumstances under Massachusetts law. See Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704, 710 (1985); Pizzino v. Miller, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865, 870 (2006).

13. The best interests of the Child focus on maintaining her stability, continuity, and emotional and physical wellbeing. See Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404 (1981); Custody of a Minor, 389 Mass. 755, 766-67 (1983).

14. Where the current parenting arrangement would cause unnecessary stress and disruption to the Child’s schooling, routines, and relationships, modification is warranted under Massachusetts law. See Rosenthal v. Maney, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 261 (2001); Hunter v. Rose, 463 Mass. 488, 494 (2012).

15. The Plaintiff asserts that the Defendant’s relocation to New Hampshire and the accompanying extended travel for visitation constitute a material change in circumstances that warrant modification of the custody schedule so it serves the Child’s best interests.

16. As noted in Mason v. Coleman, 447 Mass. 177, 183 (2006), “[t]he paramount concern for a court in deciding a custody case is the well-being of the child.” The Plaintiff’s proposed modification is reasonably tailored to minimize disruption to the Child while preserving parenting time for both parties in a manner consistent with her best interests.

17. The Plaintiff has made good-faith efforts to communicate with the Defendant and resolve the issue amicably, to no avail.

**REQUESTED RELIEF**

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Sarah Johnson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:

1. Modify the parenting schedule set forth in the custody order issued on April 15, 2021, to eliminate the Defendant’s midweek overnight visitation due to the increased travel demands and associated negative impacts on the Child;  
   
2. Adjust the Defendant’s weekend visitation schedule as necessary to accommodate the increased travel time while ensuring stability and consistency for the Child;

3. Order any other relief this Court deems just and proper to safeguard the best interests of the Child.
