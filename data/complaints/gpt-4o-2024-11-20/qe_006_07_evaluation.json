It does not specifically address hot water, essential utilities, or characterize delayed restoration of hot water as negligence. While it recognizes that landlords must comply with State Sanitary Code minimum standards for habitability, it does not itself establish the narrower proposition that failing to timely restore hot water is negligence or an unreasonable delay under Massachusetts law.",

It does not involve a landlord\u2013tenant relationship, basic habitability or repair obligations, or the restoration of utilities such as hot water. The holding concerns lack of evidence that the store had notice of hazardous conditions (sand, salt, water, coins), not any duty to timely repair or restore building services, so it does not support the cited proposition regarding landlords\u2019 repair obligations or hot water restoration.",

The denial of Building 19\u2019s motion for involuntary dismissal was error."
