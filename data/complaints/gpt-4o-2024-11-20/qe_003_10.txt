### FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

5. On or about February 15, 2022, Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a rental agreement whereby Plaintiff rented the premises located at 123 Maple Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130. Plaintiff agreed to pay $1,500 per month in rent.  
6. Before Plaintiff signed the lease, she observed water stains on the ceiling of the apartment and raised her concerns with Defendant. Defendant represented to Plaintiff that the stains were the result of an old issue that had been “totally fixed.”  
7. Relying on Defendant’s representations, Plaintiff signed the lease and moved into the apartment.  
8. Shortly after Plaintiff moved in, a rainstorm occurred, and water began dripping through the ceiling in the exact location where the original water stains were observed. Plaintiff immediately notified Defendant of the issue.  
9. Despite repeated complaints by Plaintiff over the following months, including during subsequent rainstorms when water continued to drip through the ceiling and damage her property, Defendant failed to make any meaningful repairs to the apartment.  
10. Defendant repeatedly referred to the leaking as a "minor cosmetic issue" and told Plaintiff she knew the property had “character” when she signed the lease.  
11. As a result of Defendant’s failure to repair the leaking ceiling, the situation has worsened. A storm caused water to soak Plaintiff’s couch and ruin a laptop left on the coffee table, which Plaintiff had to replace for $900.  
12. In addition to these specific damages, the leaking has caused a persistent musty odor in the apartment and possible mold growth, which has resulted in Plaintiff experiencing ongoing headaches.  
13. The water damage has made a significant portion of the apartment uninhabitable, forcing Plaintiff to rearrange her living space and effectively reducing her use of the apartment by approximately half.  
14. Plaintiff has continued to pay $1,500 in rent each month despite the diminished habitability of the apartment due to the ceiling leak and Defendant’s failure to address the issue.

### CAUSE OF ACTION  

#### **Count I: Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  

15. Plaintiff incorporates all preceding paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein.  
16. Under Massachusetts law, tenants are entitled to the covenant of quiet enjoyment, a statutory protection guaranteed by G.L. c. 186, § 14, which prohibits landlords from interfering in a tenant’s right to use and enjoy the leased premises.  
17. Defendant’s failure to repair the persistent and worsening water leaks, which have caused damage to Plaintiff’s personal property, created hazardous living conditions, and reduced the habitable area of her apartment, constitutes a violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  
18. Defendant’s inaction has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s ability to live peacefully and safely in her home.  
19. A breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment entitles the aggrieved tenant to damages, including three times the monthly rent, under G.L. c. 186, § 14.  
20. Defendant’s conduct also violates the implied warranty of habitability, as recognized in *Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184 (1973), which holds landlords responsible for providing residential premises that are safe and habitable.

21. Plaintiff has suffered the following damages as a result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment:  
   a. $900 for property damage resulting from water damage (laptop replacement);  
   b. Emotional distress caused by the uninhabitable conditions;  
   c. Reduction in the usable and habitable portion of her apartment;  
   d. Triple rent damages totaling $4,500 (three months’ rent of $1,500 each) pursuant to G.L. c. 186, § 14.  
22. Plaintiff reserves the right to amend the damages requested if additional damages are discovered during the course of this litigation.

A. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;
