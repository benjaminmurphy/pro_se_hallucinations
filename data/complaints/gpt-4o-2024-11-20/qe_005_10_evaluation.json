      "support_reasoning": "The case does address interference with quiet enjoyment, but the interference here is drug activity and crime in common areas, not persistent and excessive noise caused by another tenant. The opinion holds that a landlord may breach quiet enjoyment by failing to take measures to remove unlawful actors, not by recognizing that noise from a tenant can itself constitute a violation. The proposition overstates the case by converting a specific crime/drug-activity holding into a broader, repeated Massachusetts rule about noisy tenants, which this opinion neither discusses nor establishes.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cIn this case, we have no doubt that, if the plaintiffs truly are unable to use the common areas of the development, including sidewalks, streets, parking lots, and recreation areas within it, then the situation constitutes a serious interference with their quiet enjoyment and substantially impairs the character of the leased premises. \u2026 If the defendant failed to take any action to remove from the area of its control persons engaged in unlawful activity, then the defendant permitted a condition to exist that substantially interfered with the tenancies of the plaintiffs and thus breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment.\u201d"

      "support_confidence": "high",
      "support_reasoning": "The case does discuss interference with quiet enjoyment under G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, but the interference here was repeated flooding and unsanitary physical conditions caused by the landlord\u2019s failure to maintain the premises, not noise caused by another tenant. The court\u2019s quiet enjoyment analysis focuses on sanitary conditions and flooding, and it nowhere mentions noise, let alone holds that persistent excessive noise from a co-tenant can constitute a violation of quiet enjoyment. Thus, while it is quiet enjoyment authority, it does not support the specific noise-based proposition claimed.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\u201cThe common law background of \u00a7 14 also suggests that malicious intent is not a condition of liability. The phrase \u2018quiet enjoyment\u2019 is a familiar term in landlord-tenant law, signifying the tenant\u2019s right to freedom from serious interferences with his tenancy \u2014 acts or omissions that \u2018impair the character and value of the leased premises.\u2019 Winchester v. O\u2019Brien, 266 Mass. 33, 36 (1929)\u2026 Every tenancy is deemed to entail an implied covenant that the landlord will not disturb this right during the tenancy.\u201d"
