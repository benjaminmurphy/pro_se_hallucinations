*Defendant.*

**COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND**  

**INTRODUCTION**  

Plaintiff Jessica Thompson ("Plaintiff"), by and through herself, files this Complaint against Defendant Lynn Apartments LLC ("Defendant") for negligence relating to Defendant's failure to maintain a smoke detector in the common hallway of Plaintiff's residence, thereby causing Plaintiff personal injuries and damages.  

**PARTIES**  

1. Plaintiff Jessica Thompson is an individual residing at 123 Elm Street, Apartment 3B, Lynn, Massachusetts 01905.  
2. Upon information and belief, Defendant Lynn Apartments LLC is a limited liability company duly organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, with its principal place of business in Massachusetts, and it operates and/or owns the apartment building located at 123 Elm Street, Lynn, Massachusetts 01905.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this matter under G.L. c. 218, § 19 because the Plaintiff’s claim is within the monetary threshold for the jurisdiction of the District Court.  
4. Venue is proper in this Court under G.L. c. 223, § 1 and § 4 because the events giving rise to the claim occurred in Lynn, Massachusetts.  

**FACTUAL BACKGROUND**  

5. Plaintiff rented and resides in an apartment on the third floor of 123 Elm Street, Lynn, Massachusetts, a residential property owned, operated, managed, and maintained by Defendant.  
6. Under Defendant’s legal obligations as a landlord, including but not limited to G.L. c. 143, § 3Z and the Massachusetts State Sanitary Code (105 CMR 410), Defendant has a duty to ensure that functional smoke detectors are properly installed and maintained in the common areas of residential buildings, including the hallways.  
7. For several months prior to August 15, 2023, Plaintiff observed and heard that the smoke detector located in the common hallway outside her apartment was emitting a regular "chirping" noise, indicating that its battery was dying or had insufficient charge.  
8. Plaintiff reported the defective smoke detector to Defendant at least three times, most recently on approximately July 15, 2023. On each occasion, Defendant assured Plaintiff that the issue would be resolved.  
9. Despite these assurances, the issue was not addressed. At some point, a tenant or other individual removed the battery from the non-functioning smoke detector and left it on the windowsill in the hallway. At the time of the events described herein, the smoke detector remained without a functional battery and was thus inoperable.  
10. On August 15, 2023, a fire erupted in the kitchen of a first-floor apartment at 123 Elm Street.  
11. Due to the lack of a functioning smoke detector in the common hallway, Plaintiff and other tenants on the third floor received no warning about the fire. Plaintiff only became aware of the fire after she smelled smoke that had already filled the hallway.  
12. Plaintiff attempted to escape but suffered significant difficulty breathing due to the thick smoke in the hallway.  
13. As a direct and proximate result of inhaling smoke and being exposed to unsafe conditions, Plaintiff was transported to the hospital, where she was treated for smoke inhalation and respiratory distress. She remained hospitalized overnight on August 15-16, 2023.  
14. Plaintiff incurred medical expenses totaling approximately $5,800, lost $1,200 in wages due to missed work, and suffered damage to personal property, including but not limited to furniture and clothing, as a result of smoke and water damage caused by the fire.  
15. Plaintiff’s injuries and damages were caused directly by Defendant’s negligence and failure to maintain the premises, including but not limited to its failure to ensure the functionality of the smoke detector in the common hallway.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**(Negligence)**  

16. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 15 as if fully set forth herein.  
17. Under Massachusetts law, Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to exercise reasonable care in maintaining the residential property in a safe condition, including ensuring the installation and functionality of smoke detectors in common areas as required by G.L. c. 143, § 3Z and 105 CMR 410.482.  
18. Defendant breached its duty of care by failing to repair or replace the inoperable smoke detector despite Plaintiff’s repeated complaints.  
19. Defendant’s breach of its duty of care caused the smoke detector in the common hallway to remain non-functional at the time of the fire on August 15, 2023.  
20. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered personal injuries, including but not limited to smoke inhalation, incurred medical expenses and lost wages, and suffered property damage.  
21. Defendant’s conduct constitutes negligence under Massachusetts law, including the principles set forth in *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693 (1973) (recognizing a landlord’s duty of care to tenants and lawful visitors under premises liability), and *Young v. Garwacki*, 380 Mass. 162 (1980) (holding that landlords have a duty to exercise reasonable care in maintaining common areas).  

**DAMAGES**  

22. As a result of Defendant’s negligence:  
   a. Plaintiff incurred medical expenses in the amount of approximately $5,800;  
   b. Plaintiff lost wages in the amount of approximately $1,200;  
   c. Plaintiff suffered damage to her personal property, for which she seeks reasonable compensation; and  
   d. Plaintiff endured physical and emotional pain and suffering as a result of the fire and smoke inhalation.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Thompson respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant on all claims asserted herein;  
2. Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in an amount to fully and fairly compensate her for her injuries, including but not limited to medical expenses, lost wages, property damage, and pain and suffering;  
3. Award Plaintiff pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as permitted by law;  
4. Award Plaintiff her costs of suit; and  
5. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

**DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL**  

Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all claims so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,
