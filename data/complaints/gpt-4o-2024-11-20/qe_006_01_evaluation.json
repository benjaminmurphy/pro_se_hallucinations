Instead, it affirms a finding that there was no breach of quiet enjoyment on the specific facts, and the only reference to hot water is in a parenthetical summarizing a different case (Cruz Mgmt.

The case is about liability for habitability, quiet enjoyment, emotional distress, and c. 93A damages, not about excusing or justifying delay based on external conditions.

On September 9, 1983, the inspector again made an inspection of the premises and reported that unrepaired defects remained.\u201d"

It does not, however, mention or authorize emotional distress damages or punitive damages under \u00a7 14 in this case. The case therefore supports the availability of attorney\u2019s fees (and judgment/injunctive relief for breach of quiet enjoyment) but does not support the broader proposition that a failure to comply with \u00a7 14 entitles the plaintiff to emotional distress damages and punitive damages.",
