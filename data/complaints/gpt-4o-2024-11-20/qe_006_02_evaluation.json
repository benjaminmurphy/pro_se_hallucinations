While the opinion does not separately analyze \u201cpartial deprivation\u201d as a doctrinal category, the facts involve impaired (not totally absent) essential services\u2014heat, hot water, and freedom from vermin\u2014and the court finds a statutory violation based on that impairment.

The opinion emphasizes extreme conditions (deplorable slum conditions, harassment, intentional infliction of severe emotional distress) and calculates damages based on emotional distress and loss of value, not on inconvenience alone.
