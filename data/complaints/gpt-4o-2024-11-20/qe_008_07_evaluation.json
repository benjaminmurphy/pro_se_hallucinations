We also consider whether the member municipalities, as political subdivisions of the Commonwealth, have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the Education Reform Act. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the complaint filed by Dartmouth and the cross claim filed by Fairhaven were properly dismissed."

The court does not meaningfully analyze the contours of the covenant of quiet enjoyment or personal safety as an independent doctrine; those claims are mentioned only as background to the jury verdict.

The court expressly rejects a narrow focus on landlord intent or direct action and imposes liability where the landlord created or allowed a situation (noise from the lounge) and had the right to control it, thereby endorsing an indirect-breach theory of quiet enjoyment.",
