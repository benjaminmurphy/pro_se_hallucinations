### COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION  

**Now Comes the Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson,** and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court to modify its custody and parenting time order dated May 15, 2021, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws ("M.G.L.") c. 208, § 28 and M.G.L. c. 208, § 31. In support of this Complaint, the Plaintiff states as follows:  

### I. Jurisdiction  
1. Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, resides in Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  
2. Defendant, Michael Johnson, resides in Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, but has notified Plaintiff of his intention to relocate to New Hampshire for a job opportunity.  
3. The Middlesex Probate and Family Court has continuing jurisdiction over this matter as the original custody order was issued by this court on May 15, 2021.  

### II. Background and Current Custody Order  
4. Plaintiff and Defendant are the parents of Emma Johnson, a minor child born on [INSERT CHILD’S DATE OF BIRTH].  
5. Under the order issued on May 15, 2021, Plaintiff has primary physical custody of Emma Johnson, and Defendant has parenting time on Wednesdays and every other weekend.  
6. The current custody arrangement was based on the understanding that both parties lived in close proximity to each other in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and that the minor child attended a school nearby.  

### III. Material Change in Circumstances  
7. Since the last custody order, Defendant has decided to move approximately 90 minutes away to New Hampshire for a new job opportunity.  
8. Defendant seeks to maintain the current parenting schedule, including midweek overnight visitation, despite the increased geographic distance.  
9. The minor child, Emma, now faces unreasonable travel demands during her midweek overnight and every other weekend visits with Defendant, with commutes of 90 minutes each way creating a burden on her:  
   a. Emma will have to return home extraordinarily early on Thursday mornings to arrive at school on time.  
   b. Emma will lose significant time at home and at school-based extracurricular activities due to extended car rides.  
   c. Emma has already exhibited signs of anxiety and frustration about the long trips, which are not age-appropriate for an 8-year-old child.  
10. Further, the extended commuting and disruptive midweek schedule are not in Emma’s best interests and conflict with her regular educational, social, and developmental needs.  
11. The standard for modification of a prior custody order, as articulated in *Schaffer v. Schaffer*, 72 Mass. App. Ct. 592 (2008), requires a showing of a material change in circumstances and the modification’s necessity to serve the child’s best interests.  
12. The Plaintiff asserts that Defendant's relocation and insistence on maintaining the current parenting schedule constitutes a material change in circumstances under Massachusetts case law, including *Bouchard v. Bouchard*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981).  

### IV. Best Interests of the Minor Child  
13. Under M.G.L. c. 208, § 28 and *Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas*, 395 Mass. 704 (1985), the child’s best interests are the paramount concern in custody determinations and modifications.  
14. The current schedule, given the Defendant's relocation, undermines Emma’s best interests by causing her excessive travel stress and disrupting her participation in school and related activities.  
15. Continued enforcement of the midweek parenting time would also interfere with Emma’s health, academic performance, and overall quality of life, contrary to the principles articulated in *Bliss v. Bliss*, 442 Mass. 598 (2004).  
16. The Plaintiff seeks a parenting schedule that reduces travel during Emma’s school nights while allowing Defendant reasonable parenting time that can accommodate the longer distance between households.  

### V. Requested Relief  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  
1. Modify the existing custody and visitation order to eliminate midweek overnight parenting time by Defendant due to the unreasonable travel demands placed on the minor child.  
2. Adjust the weekend visitation schedule to account for the increased distance between the parties’ residences, such as extending weekend parenting time to include Friday evenings or modifying pick-up and drop-off arrangements to balance the travel burden.  
3. Grant such other relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

### VI. Legal Authority  
This Complaint for Modification is brought pursuant to:  
- M.G.L. c. 208, § 28 (custody modifications must be based on a material and substantial change in circumstances and serve the child’s best interests).  
- M.G.L. c. 208, § 31 (requiring determinations of custody and visitation to consider the welfare and best interests of the child).  
- Case law interpreting material change in circumstances and best interests standard, including:  
  - *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257 (2001).  
  - *Custody of Kali*, 439 Mass. 834 (2003).  
  - *Adoption of Hugo*, 428 Mass. 219 (1998).  
  - *Hoard v. Hoard*, 16 Mass. App. Ct. 614 (1983).  
  - *Cooper v. Cooper*, 43 Mass. App. Ct. 51 (1997).  
  - *Charara v. Yatim*, 78 Mass. App. Ct. 325 (2010).  

### VII. Certification of Good Faith  
Pursuant to Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. Rule 11, the Plaintiff, Sarah Thompson, certifies that this Complaint for Modification is brought in good faith and based on the belief that said changes are in the minor child’s best interests.
