### Complaint for Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment

**Introduction**  
This is an action by Plaintiff Jessica Collins against her landlord, Defendant Mark Thompson, for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment as provided by Massachusetts law. Defendant has failed to address significant habitability issues in Plaintiff’s rental unit, specifically the lack of electricity in one of the two bedrooms of the apartment. As a result of Defendant’s actions and omissions, Plaintiff has been substantially deprived of the full use of her rental property and has incurred financial harm. Plaintiff seeks monetary damages for the loss of use and enjoyment of her home and her resulting expenses.

**Parties**  

1. Plaintiff **Jessica Collins** is an individual residing at **125 Maple Street, Springfield, MA 01103.** She has been a tenant in this apartment since **January 15, 2022.**  

2. Defendant **Mark Thompson** is the landlord and owner of the premises located at **125 Maple Street, Springfield, MA 01103.** At all times relevant to this Complaint, Defendant was responsible for maintaining the premises in compliance with Massachusetts laws governing residential tenancies.  

**Jurisdiction and Venue**  

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 185C, § 3 because this action concerns a residential tenancy within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  

4. Venue is proper in the Springfield Division of the Housing Court Department pursuant to G.L. c. 223, §§ 8 and 9, as the property and parties are located within this court’s jurisdiction.  

**Factual Allegations**  

5. Plaintiff entered into a lease agreement with Defendant to rent a two-bedroom apartment located at **125 Maple Street, Springfield, MA 01103.** The lease agreement is month-to-month, and Plaintiff pays $1,200 per month in rent.  

6. Sometime around **October 15, 2025,** Plaintiff noticed that one of the two bedrooms in the apartment lost all electrical power. Electrical outlets and lighting in that room ceased to function. The remainder of the apartment retained electrical power.  

7. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the issue. Defendant responded by sending an electrician to inspect the issue.  

8. The electrician informed Plaintiff and Defendant that the issue was caused by problems with the building’s wiring and that significant repairs would be necessary to restore electricity in the room.

9. Despite being informed of the severity of the problem, Defendant has failed to take meaningful steps to address or repair the issue. Defendant stated that obtaining quotes for the repair is "complicated" due to the building’s old electrical infrastructure but has provided no timeline for completing repairs.  

10. As of the filing of this Complaint on **December 1, 2025**, the room has been without electrical power for over **six weeks.**  

11. Plaintiff had been using the affected bedroom as a home office for work. Because the room is entirely unusable without electricity, Plaintiff was forced to work from coffee shops, incurring out-of-pocket costs of approximately **$15 per day** for food and beverages, and had to purchase a coworking space membership at **$150 per month** to continue working.  

12. Plaintiff's personal belongings and office equipment have been moved to the living room, which has caused significant disruption to her living space. This loss of functional living space has reduced the enjoyment of her apartment and caused her inconvenience and distress.  

13. Massachusetts law imposes upon landlords an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, codified at **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, which prohibits landlords from interfering with a tenant's ability to use and enjoy their rental property.  

14. Defendant's failure to timely repair the defective wiring and restore electrical power in the affected room constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of her apartment, in violation of **G.L. c. 186, § 14.**

15. Plaintiff has paid her monthly rent in full throughout her tenancy, including during the period when the electrical problems in the unit have rendered the bedroom unusable.  

**Cause of Action: Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment**  

16. Plaintiff restates and incorporates by reference the allegations in the preceding paragraphs.  

17. Under **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, if a landlord "directly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant," the landlord is liable to the tenant for actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, plus attorney’s fees and costs.  

18. Defendant's failure to promptly address and repair the electrical issues in the bedroom constitutes a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment of the premises because the defective condition has rendered part of the premises unusable and uninhabitable for an extended period of time.

19. Massachusetts courts have consistently held that a tenant's quiet enjoyment includes the ability to fully use and enjoy their home. See **Doherty v. McCaul, 74 Mass. App. Ct. 439, 443 (2009)** (recognizing a landlord’s failure to address maintenance issues as a breach of quiet enjoyment).  

20. Defendant’s inaction has caused Plaintiff to incur additional expenses, including but not limited to the cost of coworking space memberships, daily expenditures at coffee shops, and undue disruption and inconvenience in her living space.  

21. Plaintiff is entitled to recover damages pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14**, in an amount comprising her actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater. Plaintiff seeks damages in the amount of **$900** for her out-of-pocket expenses and loss of use of her home office.  

**Prayer for Relief**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:  

1. Award Plaintiff damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but not less than **$900**, for the expenses and losses she incurred as a result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment;  

2. Award Plaintiff three months’ rent pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14,** for Defendant’s substantial interference with her quiet enjoyment;  

3. Award Plaintiff reasonable costs and expenses incurred in bringing this action pursuant to **G.L. c. 186, § 14;**  

4. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

**Respectfully submitted**,
