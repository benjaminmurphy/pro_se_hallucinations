**JESSICA THOMPSON,**  
   Plaintiff,  
v.  
**MICHAEL ROGERS,**  
   Defendant.  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION OF CUSTODY ORDER**

**INTRODUCTION**  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court to modify the custody order in the above-entitled matter entered on September 15, 2021, by the Bristol County Probate and Family Court. In support of this Complaint, the Plaintiff states that there has been a material change in circumstances since the entry of the prior order such that modification is in the best interest of the minor child, Ethan Rogers.  

**PARTIES**  

1. **Plaintiff:** Jessica Thompson resides at [Insert Address] in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor child, Ethan Rogers, who is nine years old.  
2. **Defendant:** Michael Rogers resides at [Insert Address] in [Insert City/Town], Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor child, Ethan Rogers.  

**FACTUAL BACKGROUND**  

3. On September 15, 2021, the Court entered a custody order granting shared legal custody of Ethan Rogers to both Plaintiff and Defendant. Under this arrangement, Ethan resides primarily with the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, and spends weekends with the Defendant, Michael Rogers.  
4. The original order was based on findings that both parents were stable, capable of co-parenting, and acting in the child’s best interest.  
5. Recently, Plaintiff has observed and been informed of circumstances that raise serious concerns about the safety and well-being of Ethan while in the care of the Defendant.  
6. Ethan has reported that there are “special drinks” at the Defendant’s home and that, on occasion, the Defendant “can’t walk straight.”  
7. Plaintiff received a video from a neighbor showing the Defendant stumbling while getting the child out of a car late at night.  
8. The Plaintiff has shared this video with the Court or will present it as evidence at the appropriate time.  
9. Ethan’s school has reported that he often appears exhausted and lethargic on Monday mornings following weekends with the Defendant.  
10. Based on these concerns, Plaintiff believes that the Defendant’s alleged use of alcohol or other substances and lack of attention to Ethan’s routine and safety pose a substantial risk of harm to Ethan.  

**JURISDICTION**  

11. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, which governs custody and visitation orders in Massachusetts, and G.L. c. 215, § 6, which provides general equity jurisdiction to the Probate and Family Court.  

**LEGAL STANDARD FOR MODIFICATION**  

12. A custody order may be modified upon a showing of a substantial and material change in circumstances and where modification serves the best interest of the child. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; *Hanify v. Hanify*, 403 Mass. 184, 185 (1988); *Pizzino v. Miller*, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865, 867 (2006).  
13. Massachusetts courts have held that a parent’s use of alcohol, especially where it endangers the child, is a significant factor justifying modification of custody or visitation. See *Brogna v. Brogna*, 84 Mass. App. Ct. 733, 735 (2013).  
14. The child’s safety and well-being remain paramount considerations in determining whether modification is appropriate. See *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 404 (1981); *Custody of Two Minors*, 396 Mass. 610, 619 (1986).  
15. Courts are also empowered to impose supervised visitation or other protective conditions where necessary to ensure the child’s welfare. See *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488, 496-497 (2012).  

**ARGUMENT**  

16. The events described above establish a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the 2021 order, as the Defendant’s alleged behavior now represents a risk to Ethan’s physical safety and emotional well-being.  
17. The Plaintiff’s concerns are supported by Ethan’s own statements, observations shared by third parties (including the neighbor’s video), and behavior reported by the school that suggests Ethan’s routine and rest are being disrupted during visits with the Defendant.  
18. Given the Defendant’s apparent inability to safeguard Ethan’s well-being during visits, modification of the custody arrangement is necessary and in Ethan’s best interest.  

**REQUEST FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Modify the existing custody order entered on September 15, 2021, to reflect that:  
   a. All visitation between the Defendant and the minor child shall be supervised by an appropriate third party or a professional visitation center;  
   b. Alternatively, visitation shall be conditioned upon the Defendant’s abstention from alcohol or controlled substances during and immediately prior to visits;  
   c. The Defendant shall attend a substance misuse evaluation and comply with any recommended treatment;  
   d. Any other terms or conditions the Court deems necessary to ensure Ethan Rogers’ safety and well-being.  
2. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.  

**SIGNATURE AND VERIFICATION**  

Respectfully submitted,  

**DATED:** December 1, 2025.
