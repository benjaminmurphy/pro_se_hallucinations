**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**LOWELL DISTRICT COURT**  
**CIVIL ACTION NO. ___________**  

Jessica Turner,  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

Linda Martinez,  
Defendant.  

**COMPLAINT**  

**I. INTRODUCTION**  

1. This is a civil action arising under Massachusetts landlord-tenant law for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under M.G.L. c. 186, § 14. Plaintiff Jessica Turner seeks damages and any other relief that this Court deems just and proper.  

**II. PARTIES**  

2. Plaintiff Jessica Turner is an adult individual who resides at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, MA 01852.  
3. Defendant Linda Martinez is an adult individual who owns and manages the residential property at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, MA 01852.  

**III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

4. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to M.G.L. c. 218, §§ 19 and 21, as the damages sought do not exceed $25,000.  
5. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to M.G.L. c. 223, § 1, as the property at issue is located within Lowell, Massachusetts.  

**IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

6. Plaintiff has been a tenant at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, MA, pursuant to a lease agreement, since June 1, 2022.  
7. Plaintiff pays $1,300 per month in rent.  
8. The property’s bathroom lacks sufficient ventilation, having only an exhaust fan and no window.  
9. In approximately September 2025, mold began growing in the bathroom near the corner of the shower, and it has since spread to the ceiling.  
10. Plaintiff promptly notified Defendant of the problem after discovering the mold.  
11. On inspection, Defendant attributed the mold growth to Plaintiff, claiming Plaintiff failed to run the exhaust fan sufficiently and takes excessively hot and long showers.  
12. Plaintiff denies that her normal and reasonable showering habits caused the mold and states that she runs the exhaust fan regularly.  
13. Despite Plaintiff’s complaints, Defendant has failed to remedy the mold or repair the underlying ventilation issues.  
14. The mold has caused Plaintiff significant respiratory problems, including coughing, congestion, and wheezing, as confirmed by medical advice. Plaintiff’s doctor recommended remediation of the mold to address her health concerns.  
15. As a result of the mold contamination, Plaintiff has had to throw away personal property, including a shower curtain and towels, valued at approximately $60.  
16. Defendant’s refusal to undertake proper corrective action has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment of her rented premises.  

**V. CAUSE OF ACTION**  

**COUNT I: Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (M.G.L. c. 186, § 14)**  

17. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein.  
18. Under M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, landlords are prohibited from interfering with a tenant’s right to quiet enjoyment of rented premises.  
19. The presence of mold in the bathroom, Defendant’s failure to remediate it properly, and Defendant’s inaction regarding the ventilation system constitute a substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her dwelling.  
20. Defendant’s actions and inactions have resulted in a constructive eviction as defined by Massachusetts law, including the standard found in *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273, 275 (1994).  
21. Defendant’s conduct has caused Plaintiff to suffer health issues, property damage, and significant stress, in violation of her statutory rights under M.G.L. c. 186, § 14.  
22. Defendant’s refusal to address the situation further violates the obligations imposed on landlords under *Boston Hous. Auth. v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184, 199-200 (1973), which interprets the covenant of quiet enjoyment as requiring landlords to deliver premises that are fit for human habitation.  

**VI. DAMAGES**  

23. Plaintiff has suffered the following damages as a result of Defendant’s breach:  
   a. Medical harm, including respiratory symptoms caused by exposure to mold.  
   b. Property loss valued at $60 for a mold-damaged shower curtain and towels.  
   c. Severe interference with her ability to use and enjoy her apartment.  

24. Plaintiff is entitled to damages under M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, which permits the recovery of actual and consequential damages, as well as multiple damages in instances of knowing or willful conduct by the landlord.  

**VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Turner respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment against Defendant Linda Martinez and grant the following relief:  

1. An award of $200 in actual and compensatory damages.  
2. An order enjoining Defendant to remediate the mold and repair the ventilation system at 123 Maple Street, Lowell, MA.  
3. Multiple damages, if Defendant’s failure to act is found to be knowing or willful, under M.G.L. c. 186, § 14.  
4. Reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, if available, pursuant to statutory authority.  
5. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.  

**VIII. JURY DEMAND**  

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all triable issues raised herein.  

Respectfully submitted,  

Dated: December 1, 2025
