**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

6. Plaintiff began renting the apartment at 123 Elm Street, Brockton, MA 02301, on or about April 1, 2022, pursuant to a written lease agreement with Defendant. Plaintiff pays $1,200 per month in rent to Defendant.  

7. On or about November 9, 2025, the hot water in Plaintiff’s apartment ceased functioning.  

8. Plaintiff reported the lack of hot water to Defendant on the same day, November 9, 2025.  

9. Defendant informed Plaintiff that the issue was caused by a broken water heater that required a replacement part, which Defendant claimed to have ordered.  

10. Despite repeated assurances from Defendant that the necessary part was on its way, as of the date of this filing, December 1, 2025, the hot water in Plaintiff’s apartment has not been restored.  

11. Plaintiff has been forced to endure significant hardships due to the lack of hot water, including:  
   a. Taking cold showers for personal hygiene;  
   b. Boiling water to manually wash dishes;  
   c. Traveling to a gym to shower at an additional expense of $30 per month plus gas costs; and  
   d. Transporting her infant to her mother’s home to bathe the child in warm water.  

12. Despite Defendant’s assurances, the ongoing deprivation of hot water for a period of 22 days (and counting) constitutes a material violation of Plaintiff’s right to quiet enjoyment of her rented premises.  

13. Hot water is a basic necessity of habitable housing and is required under the implied warranty of habitability codified by M.G.L. c. 239, § 8A and further supported by Massachusetts health and safety regulations.  

14. Defendant’s actions and inaction breach the covenant of quiet enjoyment established by M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, which guarantees tenants the right to peaceful use of their property free from substantial interference caused by their landlord.  

15. As a result of Defendant's breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff seeks damages in the amount of $450, reflecting the diminished value of her rental payments, the additional out-of-pocket costs she has incurred, and the inconvenience and distress caused by Defendant's conduct.

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
*(Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment – M.G.L. c. 186, § 14)*  

16. Plaintiff restates and incorporates by reference the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 15 as though fully set forth herein.  

17. Under M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, a landlord is liable when they interfere with, or fail to remedy circumstances that substantially interfere with, a tenant's quiet enjoyment of the leased premises.  

18. Defendant’s failure to repair the water heater for an extended period has substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises by depriving her of hot water, a basic necessity of habitable living conditions.  

19. Defendant’s failure to timely restore hot water constitutes negligence and/or unreasonable delay in addressing basic repair obligations, which Massachusetts law requires landlords to fulfill. See *Boston Housing Authority v. Hemingway*, 363 Mass. 184, 199-200 (1973) (implied warranty of habitability includes essential utilities); *Fitz-Inn Auto Parks, Inc. v. Boston Edison Co.*, 2002 Mass. App. Div. 39 (landlord failure to repair interfering conditions constitutes breach).  

20. The loss of hot water has caused Plaintiff substantial hardship, inconvenience, and financial costs. Defendant’s conduct is a violation of M.G.L. c. 186, § 14 and entitles Plaintiff to damages, including a return of a portion of rent reflecting the diminished value of the property and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses.  

21. Under M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, Plaintiff is entitled to recover up to three times her damages, plus reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.

2. Treble damages pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, for Defendant’s violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, for a total of $1,350;  

3. Award Plaintiff reasonable attorney’s fees and costs pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186, § 14;  

4. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.
