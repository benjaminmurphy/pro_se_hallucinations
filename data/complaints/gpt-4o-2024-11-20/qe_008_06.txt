**Maria Rodriguez**,  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**John Smith**,  
Defendant.  
______________________________________  
**Civil Action No. ______**  

**COMPLAINT**  

**INTRODUCTION**  
1. This is a civil action brought by the Plaintiff, Maria Rodriguez, against the Defendant, John Smith, for breaches of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 186, § 14 and related principles of Massachusetts landlord-tenant law.  

**PARTIES**  
2. Plaintiff Maria Rodriguez is an individual residing at 45 Washington Ave, Apartment #2, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150.  
3. Defendant John Smith is the owner and landlord of the residential property located at 45 Washington Ave, Chelsea, Massachusetts 02150. Defendant resides at [Insert Defendant’s Address], Chelsea, Massachusetts [ZIP Code].  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
4. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to General Laws of Massachusetts, Chapter 218, § 19, as this is a civil action seeking monetary damages of $7,000 or less.  
5. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 223, §§ 2 and 8, because the events giving rise to the claims occurred in Chelsea, Suffolk County, Massachusetts, and the property at issue is located in Chelsea.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
6. Plaintiff Maria Rodriguez has been a lawful tenant of Defendant John Smith since January 15, 2022, leasing the apartment located at 45 Washington Ave, Chelsea, MA 02150, pursuant to a month-to-month tenancy agreement.  
7. Plaintiff pays $1,450.00 per month in rent, which she has paid timely and in full at all relevant times.  
8. The property includes a main entry door providing primary access to the building, which requires a functional locking mechanism in order to secure the premises and ensure the safety and privacy of tenants.  
9. Approximately two months ago, the locking mechanism on the main entry door ceased to function properly, allowing the door to be pushed open by anyone without the use of a key.  
10. Plaintiff immediately raised the issue with Defendant, verbally notifying him of the defective lock and requesting that he repair it.  
11. Defendant initially stated that he would address the issue but failed to take any action.  
12. Plaintiff reminded Defendant of the need to fix the lock on at least two additional occasions, but Defendant has failed and refused to make the necessary repair.  
13. As a result of Defendant’s inaction, the Plaintiff and other residents of the building have experienced security breaches, including but not limited to theft and trespassing.  
14. In November 2025, an unknown individual gained access to the building through the unsecured door and stole mail packages from the hallway, including a package belonging to Plaintiff worth $120.  
15. Plaintiff has also observed signs of unlawful entry on the premises, including evidence that someone has been sleeping in the basement, causing Plaintiff significant distress and alarm.  
16. In response to Defendant’s failure to secure the premises, Plaintiff purchased a security camera for her apartment door and a deadbolt to protect her residence, incurring out-of-pocket costs of approximately $200.  
17. Defendant’s failure to fix the main entry door lock has directly interfered with Plaintiff’s right to enjoy her tenancy peacefully and securely, as guaranteed under Massachusetts law.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 186, § 14)**  
18. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  
19. Under Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 186, § 14, every residential lease includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, which guarantees tenants the right to peacefully use and enjoy their rental property without substantial interference by their landlord.  
20. Defendant John Smith, as Plaintiff’s landlord, owed Plaintiff a duty to maintain the premises in compliance with this covenant, including providing essential security measures such as a functional main entry door lock.  
21. Defendant has breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment by failing to repair the broken main entry door lock, despite being notified of the issue and the serious security concerns that it poses.  
22. Defendant’s breach has resulted in substantial interference with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the premises, causing her financial losses, emotional distress, and physical insecurity.  
23. Defendant’s conduct constitutes a violation of Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 186, § 14, which provides for actual and statutory damages when a landlord substantially interferes with a tenant’s quiet enjoyment.  
24. Massachusetts courts have consistently held that a landlord’s failure to address safety and security concerns, such as maintaining functional locks, constitutes a breach of quiet enjoyment. See *Dartmouth v. Silva*, 325 Mass. 594 (1950); *Al-Ziab v. Mourgis*, 424 Mass. 847 (1997); *Doe v. New Bedford Hous. Auth.*, 417 Mass. 273 (1994).  

**DAMAGES**  
25. As a proximate result of Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiff has incurred the following damages:  
   a. $120 for the stolen package;  
   b. $200 for the purchase of a security camera and deadbolt;  
   c. Emotional distress arising from the repeated security breaches and fear for her safety; and  
   d. Statutory damages under Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 186, § 14, in an amount to be determined.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Maria Rodriguez respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in her favor and grant the following relief:  
1. Award Plaintiff actual damages of $320, plus statutory damages as provided under Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 186, § 14, for Defendant’s breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment.  
2. Award Plaintiff reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, as permitted under Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 186, § 14.  
3. Award Plaintiff such further relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

Respectfully submitted,  

DATED: December 1, 2025.
