While the opinion repeatedly discusses protecting children from harm and the State\u2019s compelling interest in preventing actual or potential harm, it does so in the context of when the State may order grandparent visitation over parental objection, not when custody arrangements may be modified. It therefore does not provide authority for the specific proposition that evidence of endangerment to a child\u2019s physical or emotional well-being warrants modification of custody orders.",

So interpreted, the statute furthers a compelling and legitimate State interest in mitigating potential harm to children in nonintact families, an area in which the State has been traditionally and actively involved.\u201d"
