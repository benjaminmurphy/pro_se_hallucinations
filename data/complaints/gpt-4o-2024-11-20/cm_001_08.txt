---------------------------------------  
**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  
---------------------------------------  

**INTRODUCTION**  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Jessica Thompson, and respectfully files this Complaint for Modification of the existing custody order pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and relevant Massachusetts case law. Plaintiff seeks a modification of the parenting schedule due to a material and substantial change in circumstances that affects the best interests of the minor children, Emily Davis (age 8) and Jacob Davis (age 6).  

In support of this Complaint, Plaintiff states as follows:  

---

### **PARTIES**  

1. **Plaintiff**: Jessica Thompson resides at [insert address] in [insert city/town], Massachusetts. Plaintiff is the mother of the minor children, Emily Davis and Jacob Davis, per the original custody order dated April 15, 2021.  
2. **Defendant**: Michael Davis resides at [insert address] in [insert city/town], Massachusetts. Defendant is the father of the minor children.  

---

### **JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

3. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 209C, § 20 and c. 208, § 28, as this Court issued the original custody order on or about April 15, 2021.

4. Venue is proper in the Middlesex Probate and Family Court pursuant to G.L. c. 209C, § 23, as both parties and the minor children reside in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  

---

### **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

5. The parties are parents to two children:  
   - Emily Davis, born [insert DOB; age 8]  
   - Jacob Davis, born [insert DOB; age 6]  

6. The existing custody arrangement, established by this Court on April 15, 2021, granted Plaintiff primary physical custody with Defendant entitled to parenting time every other weekend and one mid-week overnight per week.

7. At the time of the existing custody order, both Plaintiff and Defendant were employed in regular daytime jobs, allowing Defendant to meaningfully exercise his parenting time as outlined.

8. Recently, Defendant accepted new employment that entails working night shifts from 7 PM to 7 AM, including many of his scheduled parenting times:  
   - Defendant’s work schedule directly conflicts with his ability to provide overnight care and supervision for the children during the agreed-upon parenting time.  
   - Defendant has repeatedly dropped the children off to Plaintiff's care with little to no notice, citing exhaustion after his overnight shifts. On other occasions, he leaves the children with his roommate, an individual Plaintiff does not know well and whose ability to provide proper child care is unclear.  

9. The minor children, Emily and Jacob, have expressed distress over these circumstances, including being placed in the care of Defendant’s roommate and being left unsupervised while Defendant naps after his work shifts.  

10. Defendant’s new work schedule represents a material and substantial change in circumstances that prevents him from properly exercising parenting time as outlined in the existing order, thereby impacting the best interests of the minor children.

### **LEGAL STANDARD AND APPLICABLE LAW**  

11. Pursuant to **G.L. c. 208, § 28**, a custody or parenting plan may be modified upon a showing of a material change in circumstances and where modification advances the best interests of the children.  
    - *R.H. v. B.F.*, 429 Mass. 803 (1999) (a material change may include a parent’s inability to fulfill parenting duties).  
    - *Schechter v. Schechter*, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239 (2015) (the court must place the best interests of the children at the forefront when evaluating custody modifications).  

12. Massachusetts courts have held that a change in a parent’s work schedule or inability to provide appropriate care constitutes a basis for custody modification.  
    - *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177 (2006) (emphasizing that custody decisions must reflect current circumstances impacting parental availability).  

13. Defendant’s new work schedule conflicts with the existing custody arrangement and places undue strain on the Plaintiff to provide unplanned childcare in Defendant’s absence, contrary to the children’s best interests. Courts routinely modify orders under such circumstances.  
    - See *Hourihan v. Hourihan*, 60 Mass. App. Ct. 808 (2004) (reaffirming the need for a parent to demonstrate consistent availability during parenting time).  

14. Additionally, this Court must consider the suitability of persons providing care to minor children. Leaving the children with a roommate whose competence is unverified raises concerns about their safety and welfare.  
    - *A.H. v. M.P.*, 447 Mass. 828 (2006) (non-parental involvement in custody contexts must be scrutinized to protect children’s welfare).  

15. Courts have emphasized that stability, predictability, and the children’s overall well-being are paramount in custody determinations.  
    - *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398 (1981) (noting that custody must prioritize maintaining a stable and nurturing environment for the child).  

16. A modification of the existing order is critical to ensuring that the children have appropriate and consistent caregiving arrangements aligned with their developmental needs.  
    - See *Adoption of Mariano*, 77 Mass. App. Ct. 656 (2010) (highlighting the importance of consistent parental supervision to promote a child’s welfare).

### **RELIEF REQUESTED**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

A. Modify the existing custody order to reflect Defendant’s current work schedule, limiting his overnight parenting time to nights when he is not working and can provide direct care and supervision for the children;  

B. In the alternative, order that Defendant provide adequate childcare by a responsible adult approved by Plaintiff during his parenting time whenever he is unable to provide such care himself;  

C. Enter any further orders this Court deems necessary and appropriate in the best interests of Emily Davis and Jacob Davis.
