**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**MIDDLESEX SUPERIOR COURT**  
**CIVIL ACTION NO. _______**

**Emily Rodriguez,**  
*Plaintiff*,  

v.  

**Somerville Grocers, Inc.,**  
*Defendant.*  

**COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND**

**INTRODUCTION**  
1. This is an action for negligence brought by Plaintiff Emily Rodriguez against Defendant Somerville Grocers, Inc. for injuries sustained as a result of a hazardous condition—specifically, a puddle of spilled milk—in Defendant’s store located at 123 Main St., Somerville, Massachusetts.

2. Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages for her medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and any other relief deemed appropriate by this Honorable Court.

**PARTIES**  
3. Plaintiff Emily Rodriguez is an individual residing in Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  

4. Defendant Somerville Grocers, Inc. is a Massachusetts corporation with its principal place of business in Massachusetts, and it operates the grocery store located at 123 Main St., Somerville, MA 02143.

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
5. Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to M.G.L. c. 212, § 3, as the matter in controversy exceeds $25,000, exclusive of interest and costs.

6. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to M.G.L. c. 223, § 1, because the events giving rise to this action occurred in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
7. On September 16, 2023, Plaintiff was a lawful invitee at Defendant’s grocery store located at 123 Main St., Somerville, MA 02143.  

8. While walking in the dairy aisle, Plaintiff stepped in a large puddle of spilled milk, causing her to slip and fall to the ground.  

9. The puddle of milk was visible, with cart tracks running through it, yet no warning signs, cones, or other barriers were in place to alert customers to the hazard.

10. A store employee working approximately fifteen feet away admitted that he had been aware of the spill for “a few minutes” but had chosen to delay cleaning it up in order to finish stocking shelves.

11. Plaintiff immediately felt pain but initially believed it to be minor. However, by the evening, the pain in her hip worsened significantly, prompting her to seek medical treatment at urgent care the following morning.

12. Plaintiff was diagnosed with a hip sprain as a result of the fall. She required physical therapy for her injuries and incurred $1,200 in medical expenses.

13. Plaintiff also missed multiple shifts at her café job due to pain and mobility limitations, resulting in approximately $800 in lost wages.

14. Defendant Somerville Grocers, Inc. failed to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition, failed to warn Plaintiff of the dangerous condition, and failed to promptly remedy a known hazardous condition.

15. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained physical injuries, economic losses, and emotional distress.

**CAUSE OF ACTION – NEGLIGENCE**  
16. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs of this Complaint as though fully set forth herein.

17. Defendant owed Plaintiff, as a lawful invitee, a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain its premises in a safe condition, to warn of any dangerous conditions, and to promptly remedy such conditions. *Mounsey v. Ellard*, 363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973).  

18. Defendant breached this duty by failing to clean up the spilled milk in a timely manner or provide adequate warnings, despite having actual knowledge of the hazardous condition. *Oliveri v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.*, 363 Mass. 165, 166-67 (1973).

19. Defendant knew or should have known of the puddle of milk, as its employee admitted to being aware of it before the incident occurred. Failure to act promptly in addressing a known hazard constitutes negligence. See *Sheehan v. Roche Bros. Supermarkets, Inc.*, 448 Mass. 780, 783-84 (2007).

20. The presence of cart tracks through the puddle indicates the condition had existed long enough that Defendant, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have discovered and remedied it. *Goddard v. Boston & Maine R.R.*, 179 Mass. 52, 54-55 (1901).  

21. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained injuries, economic losses, and other damages. *Colter v. Barber-Greene Co.*, 403 Mass. 50, 62 (1988).

22. Defendant’s conduct was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff’s injuries. *Donovan v. Johnson, Inc.*, 295 Mass. 174, 178 (1936).

**DAMAGES**  
23. As a result of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff has incurred and continues to incur the following damages:  

   a. Medical expenses of approximately $1,200;  
   b. Lost wages of approximately $800;  
   c. Pain and suffering, including physical discomfort, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life, in an amount to be determined at trial.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Emily Rodriguez respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Enter judgment in her favor and against Defendant Somerville Grocers, Inc.;  

2. Award compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial for medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and other compensable losses;  

3. Award pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law;  

4. Award costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees to the extent permitted by law; and  

5. Grant any other relief that the Court deems just and proper.  

**JURY DEMAND**  
Plaintiff respectfully demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,  

Dated: December 1, 2025
