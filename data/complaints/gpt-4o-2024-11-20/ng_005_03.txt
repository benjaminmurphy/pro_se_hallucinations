**JESSICA TURNER**,  
Plaintiff,  

v.  

**MARK DORSEY**,  
Defendant.  

**COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND**  

**INTRODUCTION**  
1. This is a negligence action brought by Plaintiff Jessica Turner against Defendant Mark Dorsey for his failure to exercise reasonable care in securing a tall aluminum extension ladder on his property. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff’s vehicle sustained significant damage, causing monetary losses to Plaintiff.  

**PARTIES**  
2. Plaintiff Jessica Turner resides at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts.  
3. Defendant Mark Dorsey is an individual who also resides at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  
4. The court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to **M.G.L. c. 212, § 4**, as the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000.  
5. Venue is proper in this Court under **M.G.L. c. 223, § 1**, as the events giving rise to this action occurred in Springfield, Massachusetts, within Hampden County.

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  
6. Plaintiff Jessica Turner and Defendant Mark Dorsey share a driveway at their residence located at 123 Maple Street, Springfield, Massachusetts.  
7. Defendant Mark Dorsey owned, maintained, and controlled a tall aluminum extension ladder, which he habitually left leaning against a wooden fence adjacent to the shared driveway.  
8. Plaintiff had repeatedly warned Defendant of the unsafe condition posed by the unsecured ladder, informing him on multiple occasions that strong winds could cause the ladder to fall.  
9. Defendant acknowledged Plaintiff’s concerns and assured her that he would secure or relocate the ladder, but failed to take any action.  
10. On or about March 15, 2023, strong winds in Springfield caused the unsecured ladder to fall while Plaintiff was backing her vehicle into the shared driveway.  
11. The ladder struck Plaintiff’s vehicle, causing damage to the hood and windshield.  
12. As a result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff incurred approximately $2,500 in repair costs, $1,000 in car rental expenses, and $500 for her insurance deductible, resulting in total losses of $4,000.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  
**COUNT I – NEGLIGENCE**  
13. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates herein by reference the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through 12 above.  
14. Under Massachusetts law, every individual has a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid creating conditions that pose a foreseeable risk of harm to others. See **M.G.L. c. 231, § 85A**; **Gillespie v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 386 Mass. 281, 285 (1982)**.  
15. Defendant had an affirmative duty to ensure that the aluminum extension ladder on his property was properly secured to prevent it from falling and causing harm to individuals or property. See **Akins v. Glens Falls City Sch. Dist., 53 N.Y.2d 325, 329 (1981)** (discussing the standard of care for property owners); **Black v. Boston Consol. Gas Co., 325 Mass. 505, 507-08 (1950)** (duty of care requires addressing foreseeable risks).  
16. Defendant breached this duty by failing to secure the ladder despite Plaintiff’s warnings. See **Mounsey v. Ellard, 363 Mass. 693, 708 (1973)** (landowners owe a duty to act reasonably under all the circumstances); **Townsley v. Woburn Foreign Motors, Inc., 10 Mass. App. Ct. 888, 888-89 (1980)**.  
17. Defendant’s failure to act reasonably created a foreseeable risk of harm that directly and proximately caused damage to Plaintiff’s vehicle. See **Levine v. Stop & Shop Cos., Inc., 40 Mass. App. Ct. 508, 511 (1996)** (foreseeability establishes duty and breach); **Poskus v. Lombardo's of Randolph, Inc., 423 Mass. 637, 639 (1996)** (reasonableness evaluated based on foreseeability of harm).  
18. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff suffered damages, including repair costs, car rental expenses, and payment of her insurance deductible. See **Pittard v. Four Seasons Motor Inn, Inc., 391 Mass. 372, 379 (1984)** (plaintiff entitled to damages directly resulting from defendant’s negligence).

19. Plaintiff has incurred the following damages as a direct result of Defendant’s negligence:  
    a. $2,500 for vehicle repairs;  
    b. $1,000 for car rental expenses;  
    c. $500 for her insurance deductible;  
    d. Total damages of $4,000.
