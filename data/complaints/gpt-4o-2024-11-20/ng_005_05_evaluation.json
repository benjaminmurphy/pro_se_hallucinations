Although the case then focuses on a more specific firearm-storage duty, its articulation of the general duty rule directly supports the cited proposition about the duty of reasonable care under Massachusetts law.",

MacDonald, supra at 677, citing Restatement (Second) Torts \u00a7 302 comment a (1965). A precondition to this duty is, of course, that the risk of harm to another be recognizable or foreseeable to the actor.\u201d"

      "support_reasoning": "The case concerns a residential landlord\u2019s duty as a landowner to remedy an open and obvious danger the landlord created and maintained (a trampoline set directly beside a shallow pool), not a duty to secure items near a shared driveway or to prevent damage to a vehicle. The holding is about the scope of a premises-liability duty to remedy open and obvious conditions where the landowner can anticipate entrants will encounter the risk, and does not address anything about driveways, vehicles, or a duty to secure objects in that context. Using this case for that specific driveway/vehicle-duty proposition would be inaccurate.",

The case thus illustrates a factual application of negligence law rather than clearly stating or analyzing the general duty-of-reasonable-care standard described in the proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "On the defendants\u2019 exceptions to the denial of their motion for directed verdicts the test is whether \u201canywhere in the evidence, from whatever source derived, any combination of circumstances could be found from which a reasonable inference could be drawn in favor of the plaintiff.\u201d ... We hold that such a combination of circumstances could be found in the evidence and that the case was therefore properly submitted to the jury for decision."
