### JURISDICTION AND VENUE  

3. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to G.L. c. 209C, § 20 and G.L. c. 208, § 28, as the modifications sought pertain to the custody and visitation of minor children residing in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  
4. Venue is proper in the Middlesex County Probate and Family Court as this is the court that entered the original custody order on May 15, 2021.

### FACTUAL BACKGROUND  

5. The current custody and visitation order, entered by this Court on May 15, 2021, grants the Plaintiff, Lisa Reynolds, primary physical custody of the parties’ minor children, Emily Reynolds and Jason Reynolds, while granting the Defendant, Mark Reynolds, parenting time on alternate weekends and one midweek evening visit.  
6. At the time the current custody order was issued, neither party was in a serious relationship, and no provisions concerning cohabitation or the introduction of unrelated adults to the children were included in the judgment.  
7. Since that time, the Defendant has entered a live-in relationship with **[Partner's Name]**, who has:  
   a. **A criminal record, including a conviction for assault and battery**, in violation of MGL c. 265;  
   b. A history of domestic violence, evidenced by a restraining order issued against him by a previous romantic partner, as documented in [Court or Case Details, if known].  
8. The children have reported alarming behavior by **Defendant's partner**, including frequent yelling, door slamming, and physical aggression. Specifically, the Plaintiff observed or was informed of the following:  
   a. On or around [specific date], **Jason reported that [Partner's Name] yelled at him and grabbed his arm, leaving a visible mark**, which the Plaintiff observed.  
   b. On a separate occasion, **a neighbor called the police following a loud domestic dispute between the Defendant and [Partner's Name] while the children were present** at the Defendant’s residence.  
9. The Plaintiff is deeply concerned that the presence of [Partner's Name] poses a risk of emotional and physical harm to the children.

### GROUNDS FOR MODIFICATION  

10. Under G.L. c. 208, § 28, a modification of custody orders is warranted when a material and substantial change in circumstances has occurred that affects the welfare of the children, and where modification would serve their best interests.  
11. The presence of Defendant's cohabitating partner with a history of violence and concerning behavior constitutes a **"material and substantial change in circumstances"** that was unforeseen at the time of the original custody order. See Hunter v. Rose, 463 Mass. 488 (2012) (noting that courts may modify custody orders when unforeseen changes affect the child's welfare).  
12. The safety and welfare of the children are paramount considerations in any custody or visitation matter. See Care and Protection of Georgette, 439 Mass. 28, 34 (2003). Plaintiff asserts that continuing under the current order, without restrictions or safeguards, would expose the children to harm, counter to their best interests.  
13. Massachusetts law strongly favors protecting children from exposure to domestic violence and other harmful environments, as emphasized in G.L. c. 208, § 31A and Mass. G.L. c. 209A, which recognize the significant impact of domestic violence on a child’s well-being.  
14. Courts have the discretion to impose supervised visitation or other restrictions when necessary to protect children. See Loebel v. Loebel, 77 Mass. App. Ct. 740 (2010). Based on established precedent and the facts presented, Plaintiff respectfully requests appropriate modifications to the current order to safeguard the minor children.

### REQUEST FOR RELIEF  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Lisa Reynolds, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  
1. Modify the existing custody and visitation order to include the following provisions:  
   a. That the Defendant's visitation with the children be **supervised by a neutral third party**; OR  
   b. In the alternative, that the Defendant's live-in partner, **[Partner's Name]**, not be present during visitation with the children.  
2. Issue any and all further orders as may be necessary to protect the welfare and best interests of the minor children.  
3. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and reasonable.
