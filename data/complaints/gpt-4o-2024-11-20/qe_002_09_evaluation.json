While he disagrees with using a broad \u2018implied warranty of habitability\u2019 theory, he concurs in the core holding that tenants have a contract-based remedy when conditions are unsafe or code-deficient.

That holding is sufficient to dispose of the only issues raised in these cases, and to that extent I concur with the opinion. \u2026 I would reverse that rule and hold instead (a) that the various statutes, ordinances, by-laws, rules, regulations and codes prescribing minimum standards for dwelling units impose on the landlord, for the benefit of his tenants, an obligation to comply with those minimum standards\u2026.\u201d"
