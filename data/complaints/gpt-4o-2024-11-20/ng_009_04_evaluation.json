It addresses juvenile court jurisdiction, parental rights, and state interests in protecting children, not landlord\u2013tenant duties or premises liability. Therefore, it does not establish or discuss any rule about landlords\u2019 liability for failure to maintain premises in a safe condition and cannot support the stated proposition.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "On the basis of this record, then, the question before the Superior Court was whether the State may intervene when parents decline to administer the only type of medical treatment which evidence before the court indicates could save their child\u2019s life. We affirm the judge\u2019s resolution of this issue. While recognizing that there exists a \u201cprivate realm of family life which the state cannot enter,\u201d Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166 (1944), we think that family autonomy is not absolute, and may be limited where, as here, \u201cit appears that parental decisions will jeopardize the health or safety of [their] child.\u201d Wisconsin v.

The court affirms summary judgment for the defendants based on the absence of any duty to maintain the premises in the particular way alleged, rather than imposing broad landlord liability for unsafe conditions. Thus, the case undercuts, rather than supports, the claimed proposition about landlord liability for failure to maintain safe premises generally.",

Ellard is a concurrence by Justice Kaplan discussing the abolishment of common-law distinctions among entrants (licensee, invitee, trespasser) for premises liability. It does not address smoke detectors, maintenance of safety devices in common areas, or foreseeability of fire-related harm. Therefore, it cannot be authority for the specific proposition about a defendant\u2019s knowledge or duty regarding smoke detectors and fire risk.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "\"The court holds that the measure of responsibility of an occupier should no longer depend on whether the injured person is characterized as a 'licensee' rather than an 'invitee,' or vice versa; the question is to turn on other, more vital factors. But footnote 7 seems to say that 'trespassers' stand apart, that that characterization is to remain decisive or highly influential.\""

The only fire-related reference is a citation in a string cite describing defects (including a defective smoke detector) that may constitute a breach of the implied warranty of habitability, but the court neither analyzes nor holds anything about the landlord\u2019s knowledge or foreseeability regarding smoke detectors. Thus, the case does not provide authority for the specific proposition claimed.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "Not every breach of the State sanitary code supports a claim under the implied warranty of habitability.
