### COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  

#### INTRODUCTION  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Emily Carter (“Plaintiff”), by and through her undersigned counsel, and for her Complaint against the Defendant, HomeGoods Superstore, LLC (“Defendant”), states and alleges as follows:

### PARTIES  

1. Plaintiff, Emily Carter, is an individual residing in Lowell, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  
2. Defendant, HomeGoods Superstore, LLC, is a business entity authorized to do business in Massachusetts and operates a retail store located at 1202 Westford Street, Lowell, Massachusetts, 01851.  

### JURISDICTION AND VENUE  

3. This Court has jurisdiction over the claims presented pursuant to G.L. c. 212, § 4, because the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000, and this is an action to recover damages for personal injuries caused by the negligence of the Defendant.  
4. Venue is proper in the Middlesex County Superior Court pursuant to G.L. c. 223, § 1 because the acts or omissions giving rise to this cause of action occurred in Lowell, Massachusetts.

### FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  

5. On or about September 15, 2023, Plaintiff was lawfully on the premises of Defendant’s retail store, located at 1202 Westford Street, Lowell, Massachusetts 01851, as an invitee.  
6. Defendant operates the retail store, which sells various household goods, including kitchenware, home appliances, and other merchandise.  
7. Defendant has a duty to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition for business invitees such as the Plaintiff, and to correct or warn of dangerous conditions that it knows or should have known existed.  
8. On the date in question, Defendant had displayed heavy boxes of merchandise, including toaster ovens and other similar appliances, on shelves stacked five or six boxes high without securing them with straps, barriers, or other protective measures to ensure they would not fall.  
9. Due to this unsafe display, one of the heavy boxes fell from an upper shelf and struck Plaintiff on her head and shoulder when another customer lightly bumped a lower shelf while pushing a cart.  
10. The impact caused Plaintiff to suffer a mild concussion and a shoulder strain.  
11. Defendant’s store manager was notified of the incident immediately, documented the incident by completing an incident report, and acknowledged the falling box was from the Defendant’s shelf display. The manager provided Plaintiff with a store coupon and made no additional offers or warnings regarding medical care.  
12. That evening, Plaintiff experienced worsening dizziness and a severe headache, prompting her to seek emergency medical treatment. At the emergency room, Plaintiff was diagnosed with a mild concussion and a shoulder strain.  
13. As a result of the Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff incurred medical expenses totaling approximately $2,500, lost wages in the amount of $1,200, and suffered pain, discomfort, inconvenience, and loss of quality of life.  

### COUNT I — NEGLIGENCE  

14. Plaintiff incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 13 of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein.  
15. Defendant owed Plaintiff, as a business invitee, a duty to exercise reasonable care in maintaining the premises in a safe and secure condition.  
16. Defendant breached this duty in one or more of the following ways:  
   a. Failed to properly secure heavy merchandise on high shelves to prevent it from falling;  
   b. Permitted an unreasonably dangerous condition—loose, unsafely stacked boxes—to exist on the premises;  
   c. Failed to warn Plaintiff and other customers of the danger associated with the unsecured shelving; and  
   d. Failed to implement reasonable safety policies and procedures for the storage and display of heavy merchandise.  
17. Defendant knew or, through the exercise of reasonable care, should have known of the hazardous condition created by the unsecured shelving of heavy boxes.  
18. Defendant’s breach of its duty of care was the proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries, including her mild concussion, shoulder strain, medical expenses, and other damages.  

### DAMAGES  

19. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff has suffered:  
   a. Physical pain and suffering;  
   b. Emotional distress;  
   c. Medical expenses in the amount of approximately $2,500;  
   d. Lost wages in the amount of approximately $1,200; and  
   e. Loss of enjoyment of her usual activities, including her weekly soccer league, for a period of at least one month.  

### PRAYER FOR RELIEF  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter judgment against Defendant and grant the following relief:  
1. Award Plaintiff compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but no less than $50,000;  
2. Award Plaintiff costs incurred in bringing this action, including reasonable attorney’s fees as permitted by law;  
3. Award pre-judgment and post-judgment interest on all sums awarded to Plaintiff; and
