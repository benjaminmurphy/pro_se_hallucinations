**COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS**  
**BARNSTABLE COUNTY PROBATE AND FAMILY COURT**  

**DOCKET NO.: [INSERT DOCKET NUMBER]**  

**____________________________________**  
**EMMA RICHARDSON**, Plaintiff  
v.  
**JACOB THOMPSON**, Defendant  
**____________________________________**  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Emma Richardson, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, and respectfully petitions this Honorable Court for a modification of the custody order entered on June 15, 2021, regarding the minor children of the parties, Ava Thompson (age 10) and Lucas Thompson (age 8). In support of this Complaint, Plaintiff states the following:

---

### **PARTIES**
1. Plaintiff, **Emma Richardson**, is a resident of [INSERT ADDRESS], Barnstable County, Massachusetts, and the mother of the minor children, Ava Thompson and Lucas Thompson. Plaintiff may be contacted at (617) 555-0123 or psm1443@gmail.com.

2. Defendant, **Jacob Thompson**, is a resident of [INSERT ADDRESS], Barnstable County, Massachusetts, and the father of the minor children, Ava Thompson and Lucas Thompson.

---

### **JURISDICTION**
3. Jurisdiction is proper in this Honorable Court pursuant to G.L. c. 215, § 3, as this matter pertains to the care, custody, and welfare of the minor children, who are domiciled in Barnstable County, Massachusetts. 

4. This Court entered the original custody order on June 15, 2021.

---

### **FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**
5. The June 15, 2021 order of this Court provided that the Plaintiff, Emma Richardson, has **primary physical custody** of the parties’ two minor children, with Defendant, Jacob Thompson, entitled to **parenting time on alternate weekends and one midweek visit.**

6. At the time of the order, neither party was in a new relationship, and circumstances related to cohabitation or exposure to new individuals in the children’s lives were not considered as part of the parenting plan and custodial arrangement.

7. Since the time of the order, there has been a **material and substantial change in circumstances** impacting the welfare of the children.

8. Defendant, Jacob Thompson, is now cohabiting with an individual whose actions and background present serious concerns about the health, safety, and emotional well-being of the minor children, necessitating a modification of the parenting plan to protect the children’s best interests.  

9. Upon information and belief, Defendant's cohabitant has a **criminal record that includes convictions for assault and battery** as defined under G.L. c. 265, § 13A, and has been subject to a restraining order issued pursuant to G.L. c. 209A in connection with prior abusive conduct toward a domestic partner.  

10. On at least one occasion while the children were in Defendant’s care, a **neighbor called the police** during a **loud argument** between Defendant and his cohabitant. This raises serious concerns about the safety of the home environment during Defendant’s parenting time.

11. The minor children, Ava and Lucas, have disclosed to Plaintiff that Defendant’s cohabitant **yells frequently, slams doors**, and, on at least one occasion, **grabbed one child with sufficient force to leave a mark** on their arm. Such allegations, if true, constitute conduct that is detrimental to the children’s physical and emotional well-being. 

12. The children’s right to grow up in a safe, stable, and nurturing environment is protected under Massachusetts law, as articulated in **R.H. v. B.F., 39 Mass. App. Ct. 29, 30 (1995)**, which empowers this Court to protect parental rights while ensuring the welfare of minor children.  

13. The circumstances described above constitute a **material and substantial change since the original custody order was entered**, warranting modification of the parenting plan in order to safeguard the best interests of the minor children.

---

### **LEGAL STANDARD AND APPLICABLE AUTHORITY**
14. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, this Court may modify a custody judgment if it is shown that a material and substantial change in circumstances has arisen and that the modification would serve the best interests of the children.

15. Under Massachusetts law, the paramount concern in any custody action is the welfare of the children, as emphasized in **Custody of a Minor, 389 Mass. 755, 765 (1983)**, and the Court must prioritize their emotional, physical, and mental welfare above all other considerations.

16. Authority further dictates that substantial interference in a child’s emotional well-being or physical welfare constitutes grounds for modification. See **Hunter v. Rose, 463 Mass. 488, 494 (2012); Yannas v. Frondistou-Yannas, 395 Mass. 704, 710 (1985).**

17. Exposure of children to unstable or dangerous domestic environments undermines the core considerations discussed in **Gilmore v. Gilmore, 369 Mass. 598, 603 (1976)** and **Bouchard v. Bouchard, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1981)**, which uphold the principle of parental fitness as a critical factor in child custody determinations.

18. Further, case law such as **Rolde v. Rolde, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 405 (1981)** grants this Court the authority to modify custodial rights if necessary to protect the children from harm.

19. Defendant’s cohabitant’s criminal history, combined with the behavioral incidents as alleged and the children’s subjective distress, would justify imposition of restrictions on the Defendant’s parenting time or supervision during visitation, as provided by **Pizzino v. Miller, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 865, 871 (2006)**.

---

### **REQUESTED MODIFICATION**
WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Emma Richardson, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  

1. Modify the June 15, 2021 custody order to require that Defendant's parenting time either:
   - Be **supervised by an appropriate third party**, approved by the Court, and supervised at Defendant’s expense;  
   - Or be conditioned on the exclusion of Defendant’s current cohabitant from any involvement or presence during parenting time with the minor children.

2. Grant such other and further relief as this Honorable Court deems just, equitable, and necessary under the circumstances, in the children’s best interests.

Respectfully submitted,  
**Emma Richardson**
