**DAVID RAMIREZ,**  
Plaintiff,  
v.  
**JESSICA DAVIS,**  
Defendant.  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

**I. Introduction**  
Now comes the Plaintiff, David Ramirez, residing in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, and makes this Complaint for Modification of the custody order entered by the Berkshire County Probate and Family Court on June 15, 2021. In support thereof, the Plaintiff states that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the initial order and that modification is necessary to protect the safety and best interests of the minor children.

**II. Parties**  
1. The Plaintiff, David Ramirez, resides in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor children, Emily Ramirez, aged 10, and Noah Ramirez, aged 8.  
2. The Defendant, Jessica Davis, resides in Lee, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor children.  

**III. Jurisdiction**  
3. This matter is properly before the Berkshire County Probate and Family Court pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, G.L. c. 215, § 6, and the Court’s continuing jurisdiction over custody matters.  

**IV. Custody and Parenting Time**  
4. Pursuant to the judgment of this Court entered on June 15, 2021, the Plaintiff was awarded primary physical custody of the minor children, while the Defendant was awarded parenting time on alternating weekends and one midweek visit per week.  

**V. Substantial and Material Change in Circumstances**  
5. Since the entry of the June 15, 2021 order, there have been significant and material changes in circumstances that directly impact the welfare and safety of the minor children, including but not limited to the following:  

   a. The Defendant, Jessica Davis, is now residing with a partner who has a criminal history, including convictions for assault and battery. Said individual also has a history of a restraining order issued against him by a former partner due to allegations of domestic violence.  

   b. The criminal and behavioral history of this individual represents a risk to the safety and emotional well-being of the minor children.  

   c. On at least one occasion, this individual engaged in aggressive behavior toward one of the minor children, grabbing the child in a manner that left a visible mark on their arm.  

   d. The minor children have relayed to the Plaintiff that this individual frequently yells and slams doors in their presence, creating an environment of fear and instability.  

   e. A neighbor contacted law enforcement due to a loud domestic argument in the Defendant's home while the minor children were present.  

6. The presence of this individual in the Defendant's household during parenting time constitutes a material change in circumstances, warranting the modification of the custody order to ensure the safety and well-being of the minor children.  

**VI. Requested Relief**  
7. It is in the best interests of the children that the terms of the June 15, 2021 custody judgment be modified as follows:  
   a. That the Defendant's parenting time be conditioned upon the exclusion of her current live-in partner from the presence of the minor children during visits; or, in the alternative,  
   b. That the Defendant's parenting time be supervised by a third party or agency at the Defendant’s expense.  

8. Such modification is necessary to ensure the health, safety, and best interests of Emily Ramirez and Noah Ramirez, as articulated under G.L. c. 208, § 31 and relevant case law.  

**VII. Legal Basis for Custody Modification**  
9. Under Massachusetts law, custody orders may be modified upon a showing of a material and substantial change in circumstances and where such changes impact the best interests of the children. See G.L. c. 208, § 28; _Ardizoni v. Raymond_, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 734, 736 (1996).  

10. The presence of a third party known to have a criminal history and a pattern of domestic violence within the Defendant’s household constitutes a significant change in circumstances that justifies modification. See _Rosenthal v. Maney_, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 261 (2001) (holding that the presence of third parties in a parent’s household can affect the welfare of a child); _Mason v. Coleman_, 447 Mass. 177, 184-85 (2006) (emphasizing the paramount importance of the child's best interests in custody determinations).  

11. The Court has recognized that where a child’s safety and welfare are at risk, immediate and necessary modifications are warranted. See _Hale v. Hale_, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 812, 819 (1981); _Schechter v. Schechter_, 88 Mass. App. Ct. 239, 243 (2015).  

12. The Massachusetts courts have also emphasized that exposure to domestic violence or disruptive conditions can warrant supervised visitation to protect the children. See _Furtado v. Furtado_, 380 Mass. 137, 144 (1980); _Humes v. Humes_, 34 Mass. App. Ct. 129, 134 (1993).  

13. The Plaintiff asserts that the requested modification is narrowly tailored and reasonable in light of the circumstances and is consistent with the principle that the children's best interests and safety are paramount. See _Adoption of Hugo_, 428 Mass. 219, 231 (1998); G.L. c. 208, § 31.  

**VIII. Request for Relief**  
WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  
1. Modify the custody judgment entered on June 15, 2021, to include a restriction preventing the Defendant's live-in partner from being present during the Defendant's parenting time with the minor children; or, in the alternative,  
2. Order that the Defendant's parenting time be supervised by a third-party custodian or supervised visitation center;  
3. Grant such other relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

Respectfully submitted,  
  

Dated: December 1, 2025
