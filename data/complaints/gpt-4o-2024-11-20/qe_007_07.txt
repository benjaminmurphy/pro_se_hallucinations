Plaintiff,  

v.  

Thomas Landis,  
[Address of Defendant],  

Defendant.  

**Civil Action No. _______**

## COMPLAINT  

**INTRODUCTION**  

1. This is a civil complaint seeking monetary damages and other relief against the Defendant, Thomas Landis, for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, in violation of M.G.L. c. 186, § 14 and applicable Massachusetts common law.  

2. Plaintiff Jessica Miller brings this action to address substantial and ongoing interference with her use and enjoyment of her rental unit caused by the Defendant, including disruptive construction noise and the infiltration of dust into her apartment over a prolonged period.  

**PARTIES**  

3. Plaintiff Jessica Miller is a resident of Cambridge, Massachusetts, residing at 123 Elm Street, Cambridge, MA 02139.  

4. Defendant Thomas Landis is the landlord and owner of the residential property located at 123 Elm Street, Cambridge, MA 02139, where the Plaintiff resides under a written lease agreement executed on May 1, 2022.  

**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**  

5. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter under M.G.L. c. 212, § 3, as the amount in controversy does not exceed $25,000, and this is a civil action arising under Massachusetts law.  

6. Venue is proper in the Cambridge District Court because the property at issue is located in Cambridge, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.  

**FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS**  

7. Plaintiff has resided at 123 Elm Street, Apartment #2, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, since May 1, 2022, under a written lease agreement with the Defendant.  

8. Plaintiff pays Defendant $2,400 in monthly rent as agreed upon in the lease.  

9. Since approximately October 1, 2025, the Defendant has undertaken a renovation project on the rental unit located adjacent to Plaintiff's apartment.  

10. The construction has involved significant levels of noise, including drilling, hammering, and loud conversations among workers, occurring daily from approximately 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM on weekdays.  

11. The renovations have further caused the infiltration of dust and debris into Plaintiff's apartment through the ventilation system, creating an unhealthy environment and forcing Plaintiff to repeatedly clean her living space.  

12. Plaintiff notified Defendant of the disruptive conditions and their impact on her ability to work and live comfortably in her apartment.  

13. Defendant acknowledged the disruptions and offered Plaintiff a one-time rent reduction of $100, which Plaintiff accepted. However, the disruptive conditions continued unabated.  

14. Defendant has informed Plaintiff that the construction and its associated disruptions may continue for an additional one to two months.  

15. Plaintiff works from home and relies on her residence as a quiet and stable workspace. The construction noise has made it difficult, if not impossible, for Plaintiff to focus during work calls and perform her job effectively.  

16. Defendant's actions have unreasonably interfered with Plaintiff's quiet use and enjoyment of her rental unit, in direct violation of M.G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

17. Plaintiff has suffered damages as a direct result of Defendant's failure to honor her right to quiet enjoyment, including emotional distress, lost productivity, and substantial interference with her daily living and working environment.  

**CAUSE OF ACTION**  

### Count 1: Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (M.G.L. c. 186, § 14)  

18. Plaintiff repeats and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 17 above as though fully set forth herein.  

19. Under M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, every residential lease in Massachusetts includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, guaranteeing the tenant's right to undisturbed possession and enjoyment of their rental premises.  

20. Defendant's actions, including but not limited to permitting excessive and prolonged construction noise and failing to prevent the infiltration of construction debris and dust, have unreasonably interfered with Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her rental unit.  

21. Defendant had actual or constructive knowledge of the disruptions to Plaintiff’s quiet enjoyment, as Plaintiff directly notified Defendant of the issues.  

22. Defendant’s conduct constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under M.G.L. c. 186, § 14.  

23. Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, Defendant is liable for actual damages sustained by Plaintiff, as well as statutory damages equal to three times the rent, plus attorneys' fees and costs.  

24. As a proximate result of Defendant's breach, Plaintiff has suffered damages including, but not limited to:  
        a. Loss of use and enjoyment of her apartment;  
        b. Emotional distress and mental anguish;  
        c. Out-of-pocket costs associated with cleaning her apartment from construction dust; and  
        d. Lost work productivity due to excessive noise.  

**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**  

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jessica Miller respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grant the following relief:  

1. Judgment in her favor on all counts;  
2. Actual damages in the amount of $2,000 or such greater amount as is proven at trial;  
3. Statutory damages under M.G.L. c. 186, § 14, in the amount of three months’ rent ($7,200);  
4. Reasonable attorneys' fees and the costs of this action, as provided by M.G.L. c. 186, § 14;  
5. Such other relief as this Court deems just and proper.  

**JURY DEMAND**  

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues so triable.  

Respectfully submitted,
