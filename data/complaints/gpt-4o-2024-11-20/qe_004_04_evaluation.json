The opinion states that if the landlord \u201cfailed to take any action\u201d to remove such persons and their presence \u201cseriously interferes with the tenancy,\u201d it \u201cmay be liable for a breach of the covenant,\u201d directly tying failure to remedy conditions causing serious interference to a quiet enjoyment breach.",

      "support_reasoning": "The court reaffirms that negligent failure to repair known defects can violate G.L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, and expressly cites prior cases where a landlord\u2019s failure to repair conditions interfering with habitability constituted a breach of quiet enjoyment. While this opinion\u2019s main holding is that a bare statutory lead paint violation is not automatically a \u00a7 14 violation, its reasoning makes clear that a landlord\u2019s failure to repair serious conditions, after notice, may amount to a breach of the statutory covenant of quiet enjoyment.",
      "relevant_excerpt": "We noted that a landlord\u2019s failure \u201cto repair defects of which he has notice in leased premises is an omission which frequently has been deemed to violate \u00a7 14.\u201d See Cruz, supra at 789, citing Simon v. Solomon, supra at 103 (failure to control floods in tenant\u2019s apartment); Darmetko v. Boston Hous. Auth., 378 Mass. 758, 761 (1979) (failure to repair leaky roof); Dorgan v. Loukas, 19 Mass. App. Ct. 959, 960 (1985) (failure to bring apartment into habitable condition and keep it so). Today we make clear what was implicit in those rulings: to support the imposition of liability under the quiet enjoyment statute, there must be a showing of at least negligent conduct by a landlord\u2026"

      "support_reasoning": "The court explicitly explains the meaning of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and ties it to landlord acts or omissions that seriously interfere with the tenancy, citing common-law quiet enjoyment doctrine. It then applies that concept to the landlord\u2019s failure to prevent repeated flooding, holding that such preventable unsanitary conditions that interfere with the tenant\u2019s quiet enjoyment give rise to liability under the quiet enjoyment statute. This directly supports the idea that failure to repair serious interfering conditions can constitute breach of quiet enjoyment.",

When the Legislature chose the words \u2018quiet enjoyment\u2019 \u2026 it must have intended to incorporate these cases into the statute.\u201d"
