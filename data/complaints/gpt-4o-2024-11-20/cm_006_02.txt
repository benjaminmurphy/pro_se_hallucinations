RACHEL THOMPSON,  
   Plaintiff,  

v.  

MARK JOHNSON,  
   Defendant.  
___________________________________  

**COMPLAINT FOR MODIFICATION**  

**INTRODUCTION**  
The Plaintiff, Rachel Thompson, respectfully moves this Honorable Court, pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28, to modify the existing custody order entered by this Court on May 15, 2020. The Plaintiff alleges that there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances that warrants a modification of the current custody order in the best interest of the minor children, Emily Johnson (age 8) and Noah Johnson (age 6).

**PARTIES**  
1. Plaintiff, Rachel Thompson, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the mother of the minor children.  
2. Defendant, Mark Johnson, resides in Bristol County, Massachusetts, and is the father of the minor children.  

**JURISDICTION**  
3. This Honorable Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to G.L. c. 209C and G.L. c. 208, § 28, as this case pertains to the care, custody, and welfare of the parties' minor children, who reside in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  

**FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND ALLEGATIONS**  
4. On May 15, 2020, this Court entered a judgment awarding primary physical custody of the minor children to Rachel Thompson, with Mark Johnson entitled to visitation on alternate weekends and one midweek evening visit.  
5. At the time that the original order was entered, neither Rachel Thompson nor Mark Johnson was in a relationship or residing with any non-relative.  
6. Since the entry of the prior order, Defendant has moved in with a new partner who has a criminal history, including a conviction for assault and battery, and was subject to a restraining order obtained by a former girlfriend.  
7. The Plaintiff has become aware that the children have disclosed concerning details about the Defendant's current partner, including that:  
   a. This individual yells frequently and slams doors during times the children are present.  
   b. On one occasion, this individual grabbed one of the children, leaving a visible mark on the child's arm.  
   c. A loud argument occurred between the Defendant and this individual while the children were present, prompting a neighbor to call the police.  
8. These developments constitute a material change in circumstances directly impacting the best interests of the minor children and their safety during visitation with the Defendant.  
9. Rachel Thompson is seeking a modification of the custody and visitation arrangement to ensure the continued safety and well-being of the minor children while preserving the right of the Defendant to maintain a relationship with the children under appropriate conditions.  

**REQUESTED RELIEF**  
WHEREFORE, Rachel Thompson respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:  
1. Issue an order prohibiting the Defendant's partner, who has a criminal history, from being present during visitation with the minor children.  
2. In the alternative, issue an order requiring that Defendant's visitation with the minor children be supervised until such time as Defendant's living arrangement no longer poses a risk to the children.  
3. Award the Plaintiff such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.  

**LEGAL ARGUMENTS IN SUPPORT OF MODIFICATION**  
10. Pursuant to G.L. c. 208, § 28 and G.L. c. 209C, § 20, a custody order may be modified when there has been a material and substantial change in circumstances and the modification is in the best interests of the children.  
11. A parent’s living arrangement and the presence of individuals who may jeopardize a child's safety are critical factors in determining the best interests of the children. See *Mason v. Coleman*, 447 Mass. 177, 184 (2006); *Hunter v. Rose*, 463 Mass. 488, 494 (2012).  
12. Massachusetts courts have consistently held that the safety and well-being of minor children take precedence in custody matters. See *Carey v. Carey*, 44 Mass. App. Ct. 186, 191 (1998); *Hemmings v. Hemmings*, 26 Mass. App. Ct. 220, 221 (1988).  
13. The presence of a violent individual in the children’s living environment is a relevant factor in assessing the appropriateness of a custody arrangement. See *Rosenthal v. Maney*, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 261 (2001).  
14. The Court has authority to impose supervised visitation or other restrictions when the conduct or associations of a parent endanger the welfare of the children. See *Bak v. Bak*, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 608, 614 (1987).  
15. An argument involving the Defendant and his partner that led to police intervention triggers the Court’s obligation to assess potential harm to the children and modify orders accordingly under *Smith v. McDonald*, 458 Mass. 540, 548 (2010).  
16. Courts must weigh the probable harm to the children against the parent's right to visitation when those rights conflict. See *Gilmore v. Gilmore*, 369 Mass. 598, 601 (1976); *Rolde v. Rolde*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 400 (1981).  
17. In light of the Defendant’s decision to reside with an individual whose conduct endangers the children, modification of the existing custody order is warranted to address this material change in circumstances. See *Hale v. Hale*, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 812, 819 (1981); *Blixt v. Blixt*, 437 Mass. 649, 658 (2002).  
18. This case plainly involves a substantial risk of harm to the children, requiring immediate intervention of this Honorable Court under its broad equitable authority to protect the welfare of minors. See *Custody of Vaughn*, 422 Mass. 590, 598 (1996); *Adoption of Nancy*, 443 Mass. 512, 515 (2005).
